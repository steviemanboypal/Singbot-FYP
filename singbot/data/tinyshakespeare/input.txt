so tell me this is who you are
they tell me ive got something more
and oh you could be loved
but i dont want the lights to find me when im dark and lost
but never on my own

cause i just wanna swing like sinatra
singing like i cant stop
cause i could never rock like a rolling stone
i just wanna live like the ones before
and maybe i could play guitar like hendrix
or save the world or end it
and then maybe theyll remember me when im gone
thats all i could ever want
thats all i want

so i got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
whoever wants to hear
and i got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat till im burnt out and disappear
but i owe you nothing
and i own my luck
oh they said youll never be alone again
but i dont think you understand me or what i fear
but you could be loved
but i dont want to lie to tell myself
im more than all the mistakes ive out run

cause im only here for a minute
and i dont care what you say cause i know
youre only here cause im winning
but i can be my own kind of rock and roll like
i dont really care if you say you dont fuck with me
and i can say what the fuck i want cause its down to me
and i got love for you even if you are doubting me
like oh my god i just cant stop

cause i just wanna sing like sinatra
with ethanol my soundtrack
cause i could never rock like a rolling stone
i wonder how it feels to burn out young
cause i just wanna die before my heart fails
from heartbreak or cocktails and
then maybe youll cry once you know im gone
thats all i could ever want
oh thats all i want

cause i aint scared of living
i aint scared of living
no i aint scared of living
cause its all weve got
what are we breathing for if we aint living
and i dont want your love
i just want to feel like im still living
and if there is no god
ill know the day i die i lived through heaven
and that i gave it hell
and if it hurt oh well at least thats living

thats all i want

sex drugs and rock and roll thats all i want
whats under the words you know thats all i want
something more than superficial is all i want
sex drugs and rock and roll thats all i want

and keep my eyes above the waves
when oceans rise
my soul will rest in your embrace
for i am yours and you are mine

your grace abounds in deepest waters
your sovereign hand
will be my guide
where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
youve never failed and you wont start now

so i will call upon your name
and keep my eyes above the waves
when oceans rise
my soul will rest in your embrace
for i am yours and you are mine

spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
let me walk upon the waters
wherever you would call me
take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
and my faith will be made stronger
in the presence of my savior

and the wind blows empty cross the plains
i have walked these plains for the whole memory of my soul

and the soul of my mothers
and the soul of my father’s fathers
we have been the life of these plains ghosts on these plains
the wind once full
the grass once green
there were plants in our hands
the time seems so long ago now
where is the rich dark earth brown and moist
where is the smell of rain dripping from gumtrees

everything familiar is gone
everything i counted on
i can’t run
i can’t swim away from this land
where is the rich dark earth brown and moist
where is the smell of rain dripping from gumtrees
where are the billabongs
the long legged birds
where are the rivers they used to flow clear
now they’re eaten by mud
who will save us
from the rabbits

where is the heaven that we hoped would be
where is the gladness my heart came to see
where is the rapture we cant recapture
where is the future your love promised to me

where is the promise of the joy we knew
where are you princess are you crying too
why has it ended was love pretended
where is the splendid world i shared with you

where are you where are you
why oh why they all now have died
where are you darling are you crying too




there’s nowhere that i wouldn’t follow
there’s nothing that i won’t do for your kiss
i love you like there’s no tomorrow
cause nothing ever felt like this
 
there’s nothing i won’t steal or borrow
i’ll travel on a boat or aeroplane
i’ll explore a world of sorrow
cause when i find you i know i know ima be ok
 
see the times are changing
and i’m sure of nothing that i know
except this is us and this is love and this is where i’m home
 
in a world that’s breaking where nothing is for keeps
oh this is us this is love and this is where i sleep
this is us this is love and this is where i sleep
 
i’m from a generation undecided
i’m restless and i can’t help changing lanes
but in all the noise and the excitement
you’re love is all that will remain
i’ve said all of my goodbyes to ego

that im sorry for the things ive done
but when i start to try to tell you
thats when you have to tell me
hey this kind of troubles only just begun

thats why it hurts so bad to hear the words
that keep on falling from your mouth
falling from your mouth

tell me
why

i may be mad
i may be blind
i may be viciously unkind
but i can still read what youre thinking
and ive heard is said too many times
that youd be better off
besides
why cant you see this boat is sinking
this boat is sinking this boat is sinking
lets go down to the waters edge
and we can cast away those doubts
some things are better left unsaid
but they still turn me inside out
turning inside out turning inside out

this is the book i never read
these are the words i never said
this is the path ill never tread
these are the dreams ill dream instead
this is the joy thats seldom spread
these are the tears
the tears we shed
this is the fear
this is the dread
these are the contents of my head
and these are the years that we have spent
and this is what they represent
and this is how i feel
do you know how i feel 
cause i dont think you know how i feel
i dont think you know what i feel
i dont think you know what i feel

the buttons on my phone are worn thin
i dont think that i knew the chaos i was getting in
but ive broken all my promises to you
ive broken all my promises to you

why do you do this to me
why do you do this so easily
you make it hard to smile because
you make it hard to breathe
why do you do this to me

a phrasing thats a single tear
is harder than i ever feared
and you were left feeling so alone
because these days arent easy
like they have been once before
these days arent easy anymore

why do you do this so easily
you make it hard to smile because
you make it hard to breathe
why do you do this to me
to me to me to me

and fought it off and fought to feel
what matters most everything
that you feel while listening to every word that i sing
i promise you i will bring you home
i will bring you home

why do you do this so easily
you make it hard to smile because
you make it hard to breathe

you must have been in a
place so dark
you couldnt feel the light
reachin for you through
that stormy cloud
now here we are
gathered in our little hometown
this cant be the way
you meant to draw a crowd


oh why thats what i keep asking
was there anything i couldve
said or done
oh i had no clue you were
masking
a troubled soul god only knows
what went wrong and why
you would leave the stage
in the middle of a song

now in my mind ill keep you frozen
as a seventeenyearold
rounding third to score the
winning run
you always played with passion
no matter what the game
when you took the stage
youd shine just like the sun


oh why thats what i keep asking
was there anything i couldve
said or done
oh i had no clue you were
masking
a troubled soul god only knows
what went wrong and why
you would leave the stage
in the middle of a song

now the oak trees are swaying
in the early autumn breeze
a golden sun is shining on my face
through tangled thoughts
i hear a mockingbird sing
this old world really aint that
bad of a place

oh why theres no comprehending
and who am i to try to
judge or explain
oh but i do have one
burning question
who told you life wasnt
worth the fight
they were wrong they lied
now youre gone and we cry
cause its not like you to
walk away
in the middle of a song

your beautiful song
your absolutely beautiful song




its 3 am and i finally say
im sorry for acting that way
i didnt really mean to make you cry
oh baby sometimes i wonder why


why does it always have to come down
to you leaving
before ill say i love you
why do i always use the words
that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you

i know id never let you walk away
so why do i push you til you break
and why are you always on the verge of goodbye
before ill show you how i really feel inside


why does it always have to come down
to you leaving
before ill say i love you
why do i always use the words
that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you

why do i always use the words that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you
why do i do that to you




who am i to have your ear
whenever i call your name
and who i to be forgiven
when certain things just dont change
and i havent done a thing to
deserve your favor and your grace
after all the hurt ive cause you
lord i must say you got me wondering

said you would save me than i looked at you
and laughed in your face
said you would heal me and than i turned away
and treated you like you were fake
in spite of me not being worthy
you still giving new mercys
day after day
and chance after chance
you never throw me away
so you got me wondering

i know the word
and the word is love
and its sent from up above
something im not worthy of

i now the who and the is you
your alpha and omega
your daddy and your savior

i now the when and its over and over again
you prove to be my friend
from the morning to pm

and i dont have a spectacular bone in my body
but you love anyway
so father i just want to say

thank you

who am i to have your ear
whenever i call




escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall
my mind is running wild trying hard not to fall
you tell me that you love me but say im just a friend
my heart is broken up into pieces
cause i know ill never free my soul
its trapped in between true love and being alone
when my eyes are closed the greatest story told
i woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor


why oh why tell me why not me
why oh why we were meant to be
baby i know i could be all you need
why oh why oh why


i wanna love you
if you only knew how much i love you
so why not me

the day after tomorrow ill still be around
to catch you when you fall and never let you down
you say that were forever our love will never end
ive tried to come up but its drowning me to know
youll never feel my soul
its trapped in between true love and being alone
when my eyes are closed the greatest story told
i woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

tell me baby





you wont ever know
how far we can go go
you wont ever know
how far we can go go



why not me why not me why not me




bump when you drive by

but this time i wanna know why i cant sleep without you to my right

harmonizing

im sorry for so much im sorry for so much

why do the babies starve
when theres enough food to feed the world
why when therere so many of us
are there people still alone
why are the missiles called peace keepers
when theyre aimed to kill
why is a woman still not safe
when shes in her home

love is hate
war is peace
no is yes
and were all free

but somebodys gonna have to answer
the time is coming soon
admidst all these questions and contradictions
therere some who seek the truth

but somebodys gonna have to answer
the time is coming soon
when the blind remove their blinders
and the speechless speak the truth


we rode into town the other day
just me and my daddy
he said id finally reached that age
and i could ride next to him on a horse
that of course was not quite as wild

we heard a crowd of people shouting
and so we stopped to find out why
there was that man that my dad said he loved
but today there was fear in his eyes

so i said daddy why are they screaming
why are the faces of some of them beaming
why is he dressed in that bright purple robe
i bet that crown hurts him more than he shows
daddy please cant you do something
he looks as though hes gonna cry
you said he was stronger than all of those guys
daddy please tell me why
why does everyone want him to die

later that day the sky grew cloudy
and daddy said i should go inside
somehow he knew things would get stormy
boy was he right but i could not keep from wondering
if there was something he had to hide

so after he left i had to find out
i was not afraid of getting lost
so i followed the crowds to a hill
where i knew men had been killed
and i heard a voice come from the cross

and it said father why are they screaming
why are the faces of some of them beaming
why are they casting their lots for my robe
this crown of thorns hurts me more than it shows
father please cant you do something
i know that you must hear my cry
i thought i could handle a cross of this size
father remind me why
why does everyone want me to die
oh when will i understand why

my precious son i hear them screaming
im watching the face of the enemy beaming
but soon i will clothe you in robes of my own
jesus this hurts me much more than you know
but this dark hour i must do nothing
though ive heard your unbearable cry
the power in your blood destroys all of the lies
soon youll see past their unmerciful eyes
look there below see the child
trembling by her fathers side
now i can tell you why
she is why you must die

my conversations are so monumental
licking on her ear i’m whispering a couple riddles
she fell in love with my technique
i made her call me boss when in the bedsheets
we both coming from the same place

we build it up to break it down
if you knew the way i feel
you would know that this love is real
but live in heaven go to hell then

just a feeling ive got
like somethings about to happen

big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say
im not taking any chances
you were just what the doctor ordered


im beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot

but for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my penll go off when i halfcock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a living and a killing off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinski feeling on his nutsack
im an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables skillaholic kill em all with
this flippity dippityhippity hiphop
you dont really wanna get into a pissing match
with this rappityrap
packing a mack in the back of the ac
backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
and at the exact same time
i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicing that
ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic
i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop f bombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are having a rough time period
heres a maxipad
its actually disastrously bad
for the wack while im masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah


cause im beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard

everybody want the key and the secret to rap
immortality like i have got
well to be truthful the blueprints
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
and did nothing but shoot for the moon since ppeeyoom
mcs get taken to school with this music
cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
now i lead a new school full of students
me me im a product of rakim
lakim shabazz 2pac nwa cube hey doc ren
yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up
blow up and being in a position
to meet rundmc and induct them
into the motherfuckin rock n
roll hall of fame even though i walk in the church
and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think its all a game
til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and
tell me what in the fuck are you thinking
little gay looking boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
youre witnessing a massoccur like youre watching a church gathering
and take place looking boy
oy vey that boys gay
thats all they say looking boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day looking boy
hey looking boy what dyou say looking boy
i get a hell yeah from dre looking boy
imma work for everything i have
never asked nobody for shit
git out my face looking boy
basically boy youre never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy cause


im beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
the way im racing around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planets krypton no asgard asgard

so youll be thor and ill be odin
you rodent im omnipotent
let off then im reloading
immediately with these bombs im totin
and i should not be woken
im the walking dead
but im just a talking head a zombie floating
but i got your mom deep throating
im out my ramen noodle
we have nothing in common poodle
im a doberman pinch yourself
in the arm and pay homage pupil
its me
my honestys brutal
but its honestly futile if i dont utilize
what i do though for good
at least once in a while so i wanna make sure
somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle
enough rhymes to
maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes
but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to
censor you like that one line i said
on im back from the mathers lp
one when i tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine
put em all in a line
add an ak47 a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now
that i aint as big as i was but im
morphin into an immortal coming through the portal
youre stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
and i dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
youre pointless as rapunzel
with fucking cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new ray gun from the future
just to come and shoot ya
like when fabulous made ray j mad
cause fab said he looked like a fag
at mayweathers pad singin to a man
while he play piano
man oh man that was the 247 special
on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to radio station the very next day
hey fab imma kill you
lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed jj fad
uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming im a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you im superhuman
innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is
ricochet in off a me and itll glue to you
and im devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
never fading and i know that haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off theyll be celebrating
cause i know the way to get em motivated
i make elevating music
you make elevator music
oh hes too mainstream
well thats what they do
when they get jealous they confuse it
its not hip hop its pop
cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make em lose it
i dont know how to make songs like that
i dont know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while im ripping any one of these s that versus you
its curtains im inadvertently hurtin you
how many s i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
unghh school flunky pill junky
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to
when im a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues
but its still tongueandcheek fuck you
im drunk so satan take the fucking wheel
im asleep in the front seat
bumping heavy d and the boys
still chunky but funky
but in my head theres something
i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and
heres what they want from me
theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had
then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it
lifes handing you lemons
make lemonade then
but if i cant batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
dont mistake him for satan
its a fatal mistake if you think i need to be oas
and take a vacation to trip a broad
and make her fall on her face and
dont be a retard be a king
think not
why be a king when you can be a god

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but thats alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but thats alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

i cant tell you what it really is
i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now theres a steel knife in my windpipe
i cant breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right its like im in flight
high off her love drunk from her hate
its like im huffing paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate
and right before im about to drown she resuscitates me
she fucking hates me and i love it
wait where you going
im leaving you
no you aint come back
were running right back
here we go again
its so insane cause when its going good its going great
im superman with the wind at his back shes lois lane
but when its bad its awful i feel so ashamed i snapped
whos that dude
i dont even know his name
i laid hands on her ill never stoop so low again
i guess i dont know my own strength

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but thats alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but thats alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when youre with em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
got that warm fuzzy feeling
yeah them chills you used to get em
now youre getting fucking sick of looking at em
you swore youd never hit em never do nothing to hurt em
now youre in each others face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
you push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em
throw em down pin em
so lost in the moments when youre in them
its the rage that took over
it controls you both
so they say youre best to go your separate ways
guess that they dont know you cause today that was yesterday
yesterday is over its a different day
sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
next time you show restraint
you dont get another chance
life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess thats why they call it window pane

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but thats alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but thats alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

now i know we said things did things that we didnt mean
and we fall back into the same patterns same routine
but your tempers just as bad as mine is
youre the same as me
when it comes to love youre just as blinded
baby please come back
it wasnt you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems
maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
dont you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault
look me in the eyeball
next time im pissed ill aim my fist at the drywall
next time there wont be no next time
i apologize even though i know its lies
im tired of the games i just want her back
i know im a liar
if she ever tries to fucking leave again
ima tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
im just gonna

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but thats alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but thats alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie




look if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip
yo

his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words wont come out
hes choking how everybodys joking now
the clocks run out times up over blaow
snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
oh there goes rabbit he choked
hes so mad but he wont give up that
easy no
he wont have it he knows his whole backs to these ropes
it dont matter hes dope
he knows that but hes broke
hes so sad that he knows
when he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
back to the lab again yo
this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him

hook
you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better

the souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking
make me king as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but superstardoms close to postmortem
it only grows harder homie grows hotter
he blows its all over these hoes is all on him
coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter
lonely roads god only knows
hes grown farther from home hes no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
his hoes dont want him no more hes cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada
so the soap opera is told and unfolds
i suppose its old partner but the beat goes on
da da dum da dum da da da da

hook

no more games imma change what you call rage
tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
i was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
best believe somebodys paying the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i cant get by with my 9 to 5
and i cant provide the right type of life for my family
cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
and its no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and its getting even harder
trying to feed and water my seed plus
teeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna
baby mama dramas screaming on her
too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotonys gotten me
to the point im like a snail
ive got to formulate a plot or i end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfucking option failures not
mom i love you but this trailers got to go
i cannot grow old in salems lot
so here i go its my shot
feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

hook

you can do anything you set your mind to man





im not afraid im not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
well walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just letting you know that youre not alone
holler if you feel like youve been down the same road same road

 during 
yeah its been a ride
i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
now some of you might still be in that place
if youre trying to get out just follow me
ill get you there

you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay em
but you wont take the sting out these words before i say em
cause aint no way ima let you stop me from causing mayhem
when i say ima do something i do it
i dont give a damn what you think
im doing this for me so fuck the world
feed it beans its gassed up if it thinks its stopping me
ima be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me im tearing down your balcony
no ifs ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album
hes still shitting whether hes on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first for better or worse
hes married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse forget the earth hes got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole uni



okay quit playing with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldnt have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know its a rap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth for that
fuck your fillings instead of getting crowned youre getting capped
and to the fans ill never let you down again im back
i promise to never go back on that promise in fact
lets be honest that last relapse cd was ehhh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax i aint going back to that now
all im trying to say is get back clickclack blow
cause i aint playing around
its a game called circle and i dont know how im way too up to back down
but i think im still trying to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didnt this fucking black cloud
still follows me around but its time to exorcise these demons
these motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now



and i just cant keep living this way
so starting today im breaking out of this cage
im standing up ima face my demons
im manning up ima hold my ground
ive had enough now im so fed up
time to put my life back together right now now

it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally
for you so i could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
and dont even realize what you did cause believe me you
i been through the ringer but they could do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on i promise
to focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
cause the way i feel im strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
cause im raising the bar
id shoot for the moon but im too busy gazing at stars
i feel amazing and im

two trailer park girls go round the outside round the outside round the outside

guess whos back back again
shadys back tell a friend
guess whos back
guess whos back
guess whos back
guess whos back
guess whos back
guess whos back

ive created a monster cause nobody wants to
see marshall no more they want shady im chopped liver
well if you want shady this is what ill give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka thatll jumpstart my heart quicker than a
shock when i get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when im not cooperating
when im rocking the table while hes operating hey
you waited this long now stop debating cause im back
im on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job ms cheney but your husbands heart problems complicating
so the fcc wont let me be or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on mtv but it feels so empty without me
so come on dip bum on your lips fuck that
cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready cause this shits about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits fuck
you debbie

now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
cause we need a little controversy
cause it feels so empty without me

little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
a visionary vision is scary could start a revolution polluting the air waves a rebel
so just let me revel and bask in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass
and its a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
well im back batman sound
fix your bent antennae tune it in and then im gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter

infesting in your kids ears and nesting
testing attention please feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
heres my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me

a tiskit a taskit ill go tit for tat with anybody whos talking this shit that shit

you dont know me youre too old let go its over nobody listens to techno
now lets go just give me the signal ill be there with a whole list full of new insults
ive been dope suspenseful with a pencil ever since
prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean im disgusting but its just me im just obscene
though im not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy hey
theres a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea itd be so empty without me

yeah
its my life
my own words i guess

have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for
not the expression no literally give an arm for
when they know theyre your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
and everything you stand for turns on you despite you
what happens when you become the main source of her pain
daddy look what i made dads gotta go catch a plane
daddy wheres mommy i cant find mommy where is she

everybody has a private world where they can be alone
are you calling me are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me like im reaching out for you

im just so fuckin depressed i just cant seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps
fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i dont know how or why or when i ended up in this position im in
im starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent
but i just cant admit
or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap
i need a new outlet and i know some shits so hard to swallow
but i just cant sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow
but i know one fact ill be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow
ill be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow
but youd have to walk a thousand miles

in my shoes just to see
what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes
but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked
just stay true to you
so dont let em say you aint beautiful
oh they can all get fucked
just stay true to you yeah so

i think im starting to lose my sense of humor
everything is so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature in the room
just as soon as i walk in
its like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
cause if i do that then it opens the door for conversation
like i want that im not looking for extra attention
i just want to be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i dont need no fucking man servant
trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of them aint even funny like
ha marshall youre so funny man you should be a comedian god damn
unfortunately i am but i just hide behind the tears of a clown

oh they can all get fucked
just stay true to you so

nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands were dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip them dont expect no help
now i could have either just
sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which im placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in
in every single place
every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant acting stupid

aunt edna always told me keep makin that face itll get stuck like that
meanwhile im just standin there
holdin my tongue tryna talk like this
til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then cause i wasnt tryna impress my friends no more
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
cause where you see it from where youre sitting
its probably 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each others shoes at least
what size you wear i wear tens
lets see if you can fit your feet

in my shoes just to see
what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes
but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked
just stay true to you
so dont let em say you aint beautiful
oh they can all get fucked
just stay true to you yeah so

sample  rock therapy reaching out
lately ive been hard to reach ive been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone
so are you calling me are you trying to get through oh
are you reaching out for me like im reaching out for you
so oh oh

yeah to my babies stay strong
daddy will be home soon
and to the rest of the world god gave you them shoes
to fit you so put em on and wear em
be yourself man be proud of who you are
even if it sounds corny
dont ever let no one tell you you aint beautiful
so

yeah
i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
but hey what daddy always tell you
straighten up little soldier
stiffen up that upper lip
what you crying about
you got me

hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when im gone but im trying to give you the life that i never had
i can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry
cause youre scared i aint there
daddys with you in your prayers
no more crying wipe them tears
daddys here no more nightmares
we gon pull together through it we gon do it
lainie uncles crazy aint he
yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
were all we got in this world
when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls
two little beautiful girls
lookin puzzled in a daze
i know its confusing you
daddys always on the move mammas always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up as daddy that he had to see
daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us
i dont see us ever being together ever again
like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be
but its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream


now hush little baby dont you cry
everythings gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddys here to hold ya through the night
i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise mamas gon be alright

ha
its funny
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up
and stuck em under the tree and said some of em were from me
cause daddy couldnt buy em
ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying
cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept getting broken into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mammas heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and thats when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre
and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it
and you and lainnie were too young to understand it
papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now im sitting in this empty house just reminiscing
lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
wow i guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
lainnie im talkin to you too daddys still here
i like the sound of that yeah
its got a ring to it dont it
shh mamas only gone for the moment



and if you ask me to
daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
imma give you the world
imma buy a diamond ring for you
imma sing for you
ill do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
imma break that birdies neck
ill go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat dont fuck with dad ha ha

*vocal turntable chigga chigga chigga*
slim shady im sick of him
look at him walking around grabbing his youknowwhat
flipping the youknowwho yeah but hes so cute though
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose but cant
but its cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if im lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and thats the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is
of course they gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they got the discovery channel dont they
we aint nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes slurp
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope
*ewww* but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the  and it goes

cause im slim shady yes im the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so wont the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up please stand up

will smith dont gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
well i do so fuck him and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy
half of you critics cant even stomach me let alone stand me
but slim what if you win wouldnt it be weird
why so you guys could just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to britney spears
yo shit christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
yeah hes cute but i think hes married to kim heehee
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd ahhh
im sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
so i have been sent here to destroy you bzzzt
and theres a million of us just like me
who cuss like me who just dont give a fuck like me
who dress like me walk talk and act like me
it just might be the next best thing but not quite me

im like a head trip to listen to cause im only giving you
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it
in front of yall and i dont gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it *err* i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
its funny cause at the rate im going when im thirty
ill be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurses asses when im jacking off with jergens
and im jerking but this whole bag of viagra isnt working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king spitting on your onion rings
*hach* or in the parking lot circling
screaming i dont give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go

ha ha
guess theres a slim shady in all of us
fuck it lets all stand up

im friends with the monster thats under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy

i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
when i blew see but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam wooh
hit the lottery oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic cause i think im getting so huge i need a shrink
im beginning to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
going cuckoo and cooky as kool keith
but im actually weirder than you think
cause im

im friends with the monster thats under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy

well thats nothing
well thats nothing

now i aint much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and dont squander it
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah ponderingll do you wonders
no wonder youre losing your mind the way it wanders
yodalodaleheehoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on ta jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i loves killing me and i cant conquer it
my ocds conking me in the head
keep knocking nobodys home im sleepwalking
im just relaying what the voice in my heads saying
dont shoot the messenger im just friends with the

im friends with the monster thats under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy

well thats nothing
well thats nothing

call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that id walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and im coming straight at
mcs blood get spilled and ill
take you back to the days that id get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i aint here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates thats great
its payback russell wilson falling way back
in the draft turn nothing into something still can make that
straw into gold chump i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket face facts
i am nuts for real but im okay with that
its nothing im still friends with the

im friends with the monster thats under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy

well thats nothing
well thats nothing

we touch i feel a rush
we clutch it isnt much
but its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us
its lust its torturous
you must be a sorceress cause you just
did the impossible
gained my trust dont play games itll be dangerous
if you fuck me over
cause if i get burnt ima show you what its like to hurt
cause ive been treated like dirt before you
and love is evol
spell it backwards ill show you

nobody knows me im cold
walk down this road all alone
its no ones fault but my own
its the path ive chosen to go
frozen as snow i show no emotion whatsoever so
dont ask me why i have no love for these motherfucking hos
bloodsucking succubuses what the fuck is up with this
ive tried in this department but i aint had no luck with this
it sucks but its exactly what i thought it would be
like trying to start over
i got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster
something i wont go on til you toy with my emotions so its over
its like an explosion every time i hold you i wasnt joking when i told you
you take my breath away
youre a supernova and im a


im a space bound rocket ship and your hearts the moon
and im aiming right at you
right at you
two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in june
and im aiming right at you
right at you
right at you

ill do whatever it takes
when im with you i get the shakes
my body aches when i aint
with you i have zero strength
theres no limit on how far i would go
no boundaries no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same
you want them when they dont want you
soon as they do feelings change
its not a contest and i aint on no conquest for no mate
i wasnt looking when i stumbled onto you mustve been fate
but so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
lets cut to the chase
fore a door shuts in your face
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open
that i wont be making a mistake
cause im a

so after a year and six months its no longer me that you want
but i love you so much it hurts
never mistreated you once
i poured my heart out to you
let down my guard swear to god
ill blow my brains in your lap
lay here and die in your arms
drop to my knees and im pleading
im trying to stop you from leaving
you wont even listen so fuck it
im trying to stop you from breathing
i put both hands on your throat
i sit on top of you squeezing
til i snap your neck like a popsicle stick
aint no possible reason i could think of to let you walk up out this house
and let you live
tears stream down both of my cheeks
then i let you go and just give
and before i put that gun to my temple
i told you this

gunshot

and i would have did anything for you
to show you how much i adored you
but its over now
its too late to save our love
just promise me youll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause im a

im a space bound rocket ship and your hearts the moon
and im aiming right at you
right at you
two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in june
and im so lost without you
without you
without you

love
dont hurt me
dont hurt me
no more
young money

love

throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
but its fuck the world get a child out her
yeah my life a bitch but you know nothing about her
been to hell and back i can show you vouchers
im rolling sweets im smoking sour
married to the game but she broke her vows
thats why my bars are full of broken bottles
and my night stands are full of open bibles uh
i think about more than i forget
but i dont go around fire expecting not to sweat
and these niggas know i lay them down make them beg
bitches try to kick me while im down ill break your leg
money outweighing problems on a triple beam
im sticking to the script you niggas skipping scenes uh
be good or be good at it
fucking right ive got my gun semicartermatic
yeah put a dick in their mouth so i guess its fuck what they say
im high as a bitch up up and away
man ill come down in a couple of days
ok you want me up in a cage then ill come out in beast mode
i got this world stuck in the safe combination is the gcode
its weezy motherfucker blood gang and im in bleed mode
all about my dough but i dont even check the peephole
so you can keep knocking but wont knock me down
no love lost no love found

its a little too late to say that youre sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just dont hurt me
thats right bitch dont hurt me
and i dont need you no more
dont want to see you no more
ha bitch you get no love
you showed me nothing but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around yeah yeah
i dont need you dont hurt me
thats right you dont hurt me
and i dont need you no more
dont want to see you
ha bitch you get no love no no love no no love no no love
ha bitch you get no love no no love no no love
and i dont need you no more
get em

im alive again
more alive than i have been in my whole entire life
i can see these peoples ears perk up as i begin
to spaz with the pen im a little bit sicker than most
shits finna get thick again
they say the competition is stiff
but i get a hard dick from this shit now stick it in
i aint never giving in again
caution to the wind complete freedom
look at these rappers how i treat them
so why the fuck would i join em when i beat em
they call me a freak cause
i like to spit on these pussies fore i eat them
man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
where the fuck is kanye when you need him
snatch the mic from him bitch imma let you finish in a minute
yeah that rap was tight
but im bout to spit the greatest  of all time
so you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
and start over from scratch and write new ones
but im afraid that it aint gonna make no difference
when i rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
its an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
from the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
you can see the sparks from hot metal
coldhearted from the day i bogarted the game
i so started to rock fellow
when im not even in my harshest
you can still get roasted cause marsh is not mellow
til im toppling from the top im not going to stop
im standing on my monopoly board
that means im on top of my game and it dont stop
til my hip dont hop anymore shit
when youre so good that you cant say it
cause it aint even cool for you to sound cocky anymore shit
people just get sick cause you spit
these fools cant drool or dribble a drop anymore
and you can never break my stride
you never slow the momentum at any moment im about to blow
youll never take my pride
killing the flow slow venom and the opponent
is getting no mercy mark my words
aint letting up relentless
i smell blood i dont give a fuck keep giving them hell
where was you when i fell and needed help up
you get no love

its a little too late to say that youre sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just dont hurt me
thats right bitch dont hurt me
and i dont need you no more
dont want to see you no more
ha bitch you get no love
you showed me nothing but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around around
i dont need you dont hurt me
thats right you dont hurt me
and i dont need you no more
dont want to see you
ha bitch you get no love no no love no no love no no love
ha bitch you get no love no no love no no love
and i dont need you no more
bitch you get no love

cause sometimes you just feel tired
feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

yo left yo left yo left right left
yo left yo left yo left right left
yo left yo left yo left right left
yo left yo left yo left right left

till i collapse i’m spilling these raps long as you feel em
till the day that i drop youll never say that im not killing them
cause when i am not then ima stop pinning em
and i am not hiphop and i’m just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when im stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop
amoxacillin is just not real enough
the criminal cop killing hiphop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
youre coming with me feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up
for shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck

till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bones collapse
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bones collapse

music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when youre real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again
so while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end
cause im at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in
i got a list heres the order of my list that its in
it goes reggie jayz tupac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy so when i’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me
thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me

soon as a  starts i eat it at mc’s heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and its absurd how people hang on every word
i’ll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse
that’s why i’m clever when i put together every 
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i’m an addict
i rap like i’m addicted to smack like i’m kim mathers
but i don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full blown attack i’m launching at them
the track is on some battling raps who want some static
cause i don’t really think that the fact that i’m slim matters
a plaque of platinum status is whack if im not the baddest so

until the roof
the roof comes off
until my legs
give out from underneath me

i will not fall
i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat me

my teas gone cold im wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and i cant see at all
and even if i could itll all be gray but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that its not so bad its not so bad

dear slim i wrote you but you still aint calling

i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what youre saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put em on
cause i dont really got shit else so that shit helps when im depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
its like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriends jealous cause i talk about you 247

she dont know what it was like for people like us growing up

the morning rain clouds up my window and i cant see at all

to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
and whats this shit about us meant to be together

before you hurt yourself i think that youll be doing just fine
if you relax a little im glad i inspire you but stan

some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to
come to think about it his name was it was you
damn

tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going
not taking nothing from no one give em hell long as im breathing

before i ever had a multiplatinum selling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i dont on second thought i just fucking wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldnt picture leaving her side
even if i hated kim i grit my teeth and id try
to make it work with her at least for hailies sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but im only human but im man enough to face them today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take them bullets outta that gun
cause ida killed him shit i wouldve shot kim and him both
its my life id like to welcome yall to the eminem show

im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry but tonight
im cleaning out my closet one more time
i said im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry but tonight
im cleaning out my closet

now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissing
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
bitching that someones always going through her purse and shits missing
going through public housing systems victim of munchhausens syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasnt
til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach
doesnt it wasnt it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what youre getting older now and its cold when youre lonely
and nathans growing up so quick hes gonna know that youre phony
and hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
but youll never see her  she wont even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
bitch do your song  keep telling yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead  dead to you as can be

im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry but tonight
im cleaning out my closet one more time
i said im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry but tonight
im cleaning out my closet

im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry but tonight
im cleaning out my closet one more time
i said im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry but tonight
im cleaning out my closet

god come on

on the first page of our story
the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
i don’t know why i’m still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you’ll always be my hero
even though you’ve lost your mind


just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that’s all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that’s all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
oh i love the way you lie

now there’s gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war you’ll always win
even when i’m right
‘cause you feed me fables from your hand
with violent words and empty threats
and it’s sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied

so maybe i’m a masochist
i try to run but i don’t wanna ever leave
til the walls are goin’ up
in smoke with all our memories

its morning you wake a sun ray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
hush baby speak softly tell me youre awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night
so i can push you off me
try and touch me so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and i’ll follow you like a lost puppy
baby without you i’m nothing i’m so lost hug me
then tell me how ugly i am but that you’ll always love me
then after that shove me in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we’re on two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
that we’ll have each other’s backs ’cause we’re that lucky
together we move mountains let’s not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice yeah but who’s countin’
i may have hit you three times i’m startin’ to lose count
but together we’ll live forever we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy we’re nuts but i refuse counsellin’
this house is too huge if you move out i’ll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground ain’t shit you can do about it
cause with you i’m in my fuckin’ mind without you i’m out it

i love the way you lie

said you want a little company
and i love it cause the thrills cheap
said you left him for good this time
still if he knew i was here hed wanna kill me
but its time you met the real me filthy
but wasnt always will be
your pill refill feeling ill still be
your addiction you can touch a prescription but dont fill me
i let you see my dark side but like a mic check you got one too
so when the sparks fly we hit the flight deck and got sprung pew
like an ejector seat from an f15
but tonight we dont need those pills just the effects of each other
but we gon film cause i will want your ex to see
get it that

i only call you when its half past five
the only time that ill be by your side
i only love it when you touch me not feel me
when im fucked up thats the real me
when im fucked up thats the real me yeah
i only fuck you when its half past five
the only time id ever call you mine
i only love it when you touch me not feel me
when im fucked up thats the real me
when im fucked up thats the real me babe

and every time he hurt you i heard you
your shoulder to cry on
and ill be damned if i werent who you turned to
you said he drove you to my arms
but dont you know remember when i told you
i would never let down my guard
and i hope you feel like dirt when i hold you
cause is it really over
but you just want a little company
and you just really wanna thrill seek
said you left him for good this time
bullshit what your friends do spill beans
or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
but these hills see from that pov
we can touch but the only way youll feel me
is with a camera film me
youre nothing but a barfly
you got your sights set on the one who you run to
but im a far cry from what you might get if we come true
so keep texting me but at night if you seek those thrills
what i expect to be
cause if you cheat on him just means i will be the next to be
your ex so no complexities just sex
and dont lecture me just accept that

i only call you when its half past five
the only time that ill be by your side
i only love it when you touch me not feel me
when im fucked up thats the real me
when im fucked up thats the real me yeah
i only fuck you when its half past five
the only time id ever call you mine
i only love it when you touch me not feel me
when im fucked up thats the real me
when im fucked up thats the real me babe

hills have eyes the hills have voice
who are you to judge who are you to judge
hide your lies girl hide your lies
only you to trust only you

i only call you when its half past five
the only time that ill be by your side
i only love it when you touch me not feel me
when im fucked up thats the real me
when im fucked up thats the real me yeah
i only fuck you when its half past five
the only time id ever call you mine
i only love it when you touch me not feel me
when im fucked up thats the real me
when im fucked up thats the real me babe

feels like a close its coming to
fuck am i gonna do
its too late to start over
this is the only thing i thing i know

sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
find different ways to word the same old song
ever since i came a long
from the day the song called hi my name is dropped
started thinkin my name was fault
cause any time things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on
the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan
tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
gangsta nah courageous balls
had to change my style they said im way too soft
and i sound like az amp nas out came the claws
and the fangs been out since then
but up until the instant that i went against it
it was ingrained in me that i wouldnt amount to a shitstain i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
do i really belong in this game i pondered
i just wanna play my part should i make waves or not
so back and forth in my brain the tugowar wages on
i dont wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform i was raised upon
but sometimes you gotta take a loss
and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
keep pluggin its your only outlet
and your only outfit so you know theyre gonna talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
feel like ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme
what i really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story
bet cha feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are
when i was afraid ta

i was a afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way out
afraid id never be found
i dont wanna go another round
an angry mans power will shut you up
trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run
guts over fear the time is near
guts over fear i shed a tear
for all the times i let you push me round
and let you keep me down
now i got guts over fear guts over fear

feels like a close its coming to
fuck am i gonna do
its too late to start over
this is the only thing i thing i know

i know what its like i was there once single parents
hate your appearance did you struggle to find your place in this world
and the pain spawns all the anger on
but it wasnt until i put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
that i made a spark started to spit hard as shit
learned how to harness it while the reins were off
and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck
haters started to appreciate my art
and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain ive caused
but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone
and the lights go out in that trailer park
and the window is closing and theres nowhere else that i can go with flows
and im frozen cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun
so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song
but id rather make not afraid 2 than make another motherfucking we made you uh
and i dont wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs
my demise and my uprise pray to god
i just opened enough eyes later on
gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use thatll make ya strong
enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt
cause i cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
just having to balance my dang self
when on eggshells i was made to walk
but thank you ma cause that gave me the
strength to cause
so when they empty that stadium
least i made it out ta that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
so this is for every kid who alls they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song
and everything youre scared to say dont be afraid to say no more
from this day forward just let them assholes talk
take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when im gone
and to think i was a

i was a afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way ooout
afraid id never be found
i dont wanna go another round
an angry mans power will shut you up
trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run
guts over fear the time is near
guts over fear i shed a tear
for all the times i let you push me round
and let you keep me down
now i got guts over fear guts over fear

whats wrong with the world mama
people living like they aint got no mamas
i think the whole worlds addicted to the drama
only attracted to the things that bring you trauma
overseas yeah we trying to stop terrorism
but we still got terrorists here living
in the usa the big cia
the bloods and the crips and the
but if you only have love for your own race
then you only leave space to discriminate
and to discriminate only generates hate
and when you hate then youre bound to get irate
madness is what you demonstrate
and thats exactly how anger works and operates
man you gotta have love thisll set us straight
take control of your mind and meditate
let your soul gravitate to the love

people killing people dying
children hurt and you hear them crying
will you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father help us
send some guidance from above
these people got me got me questioning

where is the love love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love the love

it just aint the same old ways have changed
new days are strange is the world insane
if love and peace is so strong
why are there pieces of love that dont belong
nations dropping bombs
chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
with ongoing suffering as the youth die young
so ask yourself is the loving really gone
so i can ask myself really what is going wrong
with this world that we living in people keep on giving in
making wrong decisions only visions of them dividends
not respecting each other deny thy brother
a war is going on but the reasons undercover
the truth is kept secret and swept under the rug
if you never know truth then you never know love
wheres the love all come on i dont know
wheres the truth all come on i dont know
and wheres the love

people killing people dying
children hurt and you hear them crying
will you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek
father father father help us
send some guidance from above
these people got me got me questioning

where is the love love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love
where is the love the love the love

i feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
as im getting older all people get colder
most of us only care about money making
selfishness got us following the wrong direction
wrong information always shown by the media
negative images is the main criteria
infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
whatever happened to the values of humanity
whatever happened to the fairness and equality
instead of spreading love we spreading animosity
lack of understanding leading us away from unity
thats the reason why sometimes im feeling under
thats the reason why sometimes im feeling down
its no wonder why sometimes im feeling under
gotta keep my faith alive until love is found
now ask yourself

where is the love
where is the love
where is the love
where is the love
father father father help us
send some guidance from above
these people got me got me questioning
where is the love

now sing with me all
one world one world
we only got
one world one world
thats all we got one world one world
and somethings wrong with it
somethings wrong with it
somethings wrong with the world
we only got one world one world
thats all we got one world one worldis it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you now 
you got someone to blame
you say

one love
one life
when its one need
in the night
one love
we get to share it
leaves you baby if you 
dont care for it

did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without
well its

too late
tonight
to drag the past out into the light
were one but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other
one

have you come here for forgiveness
have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head

did i ask too much
more than a lot
you gave me nothing
now its all i got
were one
but were not the same
well we 
hurt each other
then we do it again
you say
love is a temple
love a higher law
love is a temple
love the higher law
you ask me to enter
but then you make me crawl
and i cant be holding on
to what you got
when all you got is hurt

one love
one blood
one life
you got to do what you should
one life
with each other
sisters
brothers
one life
but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other

onelife

one




the heart is a bloom
shoots up through the stony ground
theres no room
no space to rent in this town

youre out of luck
and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck
and youre not moving anywhere

you thought youd found a friend
to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand
in return for grace

its a beautiful day
sky falls you feel like
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away

youre on the road
but youve got no destination
youre in the mud
in the maze of her imagination

you love this town
even if that doesnt ring true
youve been all over
and its been all over you

its a beautiful day
dont let it get away
its a beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
teach me
i know im not a hopeless case

see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light
and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colors came out

it was a beautiful day
dont let it get away
beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
reach me
i know im not a hopeless case

what you dont have you dont need it now
what you dont know you can feel it somehow
what you dont have you dont need it now
dont need it now
was a beautiful day




im not afraid
of anything in this world
theres nothing you can throw at me
that i havent already heard

im just trying to find
a decent melody
a song that i can sing
in my own company

i never thought you were a fool
but darling look at you
you gotta stand up straight
carry your own weight
these tears are going nowhere baby

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and now you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i will not forsake
the colors that you bring
the nights you filled with fireworks
they left you with nothing

i am still enchanted
by the light you brought to me
i listen through your ears
through your eyes i can see

and you are such a fool
to worry like you do
i know its tough
and you can never get enough
of what you dont really need now
my oh my

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

oh love look at you now
youve got yourself stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i was unconscious half asleep
the water is warm til you discover how deep

i wasnt jumping for me it was a fall
its a long way down to nothing at all

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if our way should falter
along the stony pass

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if your way should falter
along this stony pass

its just a moment
this time will pass




youve got a face not spoiled by beauty
i have some scars from where ive been
youve got eyes that can see right through me
youre not afraid of anything theyve seen

i was told that i would feel
nothing the first time
i dont know how these cuts heal
but in you i found a right

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
that we shouldnt doubt
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

you let me into a conversation
a conversation only we could make
youre breaking into my imagination
whatevers in there is yours to take

i was told id feel
nothing the first time
you were slow to heal
but this could be the night

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
within and without
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

and im a long way
from your hill on calvary
and im a long way
from where i was where i need to be

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a kiss
i stole from your mouth
and there is a light
dont let it go out




the sea wants to kiss the golden shore
the sunlight warms your skin
all the beauty thats been lost before
wants to find us again

i cant fight you anymore
its you im fighting for
the sea throws rocks together
but time leaves us polished stones

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

birds fly high in the summer sky
and rest on the breeze
the same wind will take care of you and i
well build our house in the trees

your heart is on my sleeve
did you put it there with a magic marker
for years i would believe
that the world couldnt wash it away

cause we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

are we tough enough
for ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love




yes

i cant believe the news today
oh i cant close my eyes 
and make it go away
how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonight

broken bottles under childrens feet
bodies strewn across the dead end street
but i wont heed the battle call
it puts my back up
puts my back up against the wall

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

and the battles just begun
theres many lost but tell me who has won
the trench is dug within our hearts
and mothers children brothers sisters 
torn apart

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonighttonight 

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

wipe the tears from your eyes
wipe your tears away
oh wipe your tears away
oh wipe your tears away
sunday bloody sunday
oh wipe your blood shot eyes
sunday bloody sunday

sunday bloody sunday sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday sunday bloody sunday

and its true we are immune
when fact is fiction and tv reality
and today the millions cry
we eat and drink while tomorrow they die

sunday bloody sunday

the real battle just begun
to claim the victory jesus won
on

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

see the stone set in your eyes
see the thorn twist in your side
i wait for you

sleight of hand and twist of fate
on a bed of nails she makes me wait
and i wait without you

with or without you
with or without you

through the storm we reach the shore
you give it all but i want more
and im waiting for you

with or without you
with or without you
i cant live
with or without you

and you give yourself away
and you give yourself away
and you give
and you give
and you give yourself away

my hands are tied
my body bruised shes got me with
nothing to win and
nothing left to lose

and you give yourself away
and you give yourself away
and you give
and you give
and you give yourself away

with or without you
with or without you
i cant live
with or without you

with or without you
with or without you
i cant live
with or without you
with or without you




is there a time for keeping a distance 
a time to turn your eyes away 
is there a time for keeping your head down 
for getting on with your day 

is there a time for kohl and lipstick 
a time for cutting hair 
is there a time for high street shopping 
to find the right dress to wear 

here she comes 
heads turn around 
here she comes 
to take her crown 

is there a time to walk for cover 
a time for kiss and tell 
is there a time for different colors 
different names you find it hard to spell 

is there a time for first communion 
a time for east 17 
is there a time to turn the mecca 
is there a time to be a beauty queen 

here she comes 
beauty plays the crown 
here she comes 
surreal in her crown 

pavarotti
dici che il fiume 
trova la via al mare 
e come il fiume 
giungerai a me 
oltre i confini 
e le terre assetate 
dici che come fiume 
come fiume 
lamore giunger 
lamore 
e non so pi pregare 
e nellamore non so pi sperare 
e quellamore non so pi aspettare 

english translation

you say that the river 
finds the way to the sea 
and as the river 
youll come to me 
beyond the borders 
and the thirsty lands

every breaking wave on the shore
tells the next one therell be one more
and every gambler knows that to lose
is what youre really there for

summer i was fearless
now i speak into an answer phone
like every fallen leaf on the breeze
winter wouldnt leave it alone alone


if you go
if you go your way and i go mine
are we so
are we so helpless against the tide
baby every dog on the street
knows that were in love with defeat
are we ready to be swept off our feet
and stop chasing every breaking wave

every sailor knows that the sea
is a friend made enemy
every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
to live without intimacy

i thought i heard the captains voice
but its hard to listen while you preach
like every broken wave on the shore
this is as far as i could reach



the sea knows where are the rocks
and drowning is no sin
you know where my heart is
the same place that yours has been
we know that we fear to win
and so we end before we begin
before we begin






my love throws me like a rubber ball
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
she wont catch me or break my fall
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
babys got blue skies up ahead
but in this im a rain cloud
you know she likes a dry kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

im losing you
im losing you yeah
aint love the sweetest thing

i wanted to run but she made me crawl
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
eternal fire she turned me to straw
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
you know i got black eyes
but they burn so brightly for her
this is a blind kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

im losing you
oh oh oh im losing you
aint love the sweetest thing

blueeyed boy meets a browneyed girl
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
you can sew it up but you still see the tear
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
babys got blue skies up ahead
but in this im a rain cloud
ours is a stormy kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

green light seven eleven 
you stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
you dont smoke dont even want to 
hey now check your change 
dressed up like a car crash 
your wheels are turning but youre upside down 
you say when he hits you you dont mind 
because when he hurts you you feel alive 
hey babe is that what it is 

red lights gray morning 
you stumble out of a hole in the ground 
a vampire or a victim 
it depends on whos around 
you used to stay in to watch the adverts 
you could lip synch to the talk shows 

and if you look you look through me 
and when you talk you talk at me 
and when i touch you you dont feel a thing 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
stayand the day would keep its trust 
stayand the night would be enough 

faraway so close 
up with the static and the radio 
with satelite television 
you can go anywhere 
miami new orleans 
london belfast and berlin 

and if you listen i cant call 
and if you jump you just might fall 
and if you shout ill only hear you 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
staythen the day would keep its trust 
staywith the demons you drowned 
staywith the spirit i found 
stayand the night would be enough 

three oclock in the morning 
its quiet and theres no one around 
just the bang and the clatter 
as an angel runs to ground 

just the bang 
and the clatter 
as an angel 
hits the ground




tough you think youve got the stuff
youre telling me and anyone
youre hard enough

you dont have to put up a fight
you dont have to always be right
let me take some of the punches
for you tonight

listen to me now
i need to let you know
you dont have to go it alone

and its you when i look in the mirror
and its you when i dont pick up the phone
sometimes you cant make it on your own

we fight all the time
you and ithats alright

i dont needi dont need to hear you say
that if we werent so alike
youd like me a whole lot more

listen to me now
i need to let you know
you dont have to go it alone

and its you when i look in the mirror
and its you when i dont pick up the phone
sometimes you cant make it on your own

i know that we dont talk
im sick of it all
can  you  hear  me  when  i 
sing youre the reason i sing
youre the reason why the opera is in me

where are we now
ive still got to let you know
a house still doesnt make a home
dont leave me here alone

and its you when i look in the mirror
and its you that makes it hard to let go
sometimes you cant make it on your own
sometimes you cant make it
the best you can do is to fake it
sometimes you cant make it on your own




and love is not the easy thing
the only baggage
that you can bring
and love is not the easy thing
the only baggage you can bring
is all that you cant leave behind

and if the darkness is to keep us apart
and if the daylight feels like its a long way off
and if your glass heart should crack
and for a second you turn back
oh no be strong

walk on
walk on
what you got they cant steal it
no they cant even feel it

walk on
walk on
stay safe tonight

youre packing a suitcase for a place
none of us has been
a place that has to be believed
to be seen

you could have flown away
a singing bird
in an open cage
who will only fly
only fly for freedom

walk on
walk on
what you got
they cant deny it
cant sell it or buy it

walk on
walk on
stay safe tonight

and i know it aches
how your heart it breaks
and you can only take so much

walk on
walk on

home
hard to know what it is
if you never had one

home
i cant say where it is
but i know im going

home
thats where the hurt is

and i know it aches
and your heart it breaks
and you can only take so much
walk on

leave it behind
youve got to leave it behind

all that you fashion
all that you make
all that you build
all that you break

all that you measure
all that you steal
all this you can leave behind

all that you reason
all that you care

its only time
and ill never fill up all my mind 

all that you sense
all that you speak
all you dress up
and all that you scheme

all you create
all that you wreck
all that you hate




 1
i was chasing down the days of fear
chasing down a dream before it disappeared
i was aching to be somewhere near
your voice was all i heard
i was shaking from a storm in me
haunted by the spectres that we had to see
yeah i wanted to be the melody
above the noise above the hurt


i was young
not dumb
just wishing to be blinded
by you
brand new
and we were pilgrims on our way


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
heard a song that made some sense out of the world
everything i ever lost now has been returned
in the most beautiful sound id ever heard

 2
we got language so we cant communicate
religion so i can love and hate
music so i can exaggerate my pain and give it a name


i was young
not dumb
just wishing to be blinded
by you
brand new
and we were pilgrims on our way


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
heard a song that made some sense out of the world
everything i ever lost now has been returned
in the most beautiful sound id ever heard

bridge
we can hear you
we can hear you
we can hear you


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
i get so many things i dont deserve
all the stolen voices will someday be returned
the most beautiful sound id ever heard


your voices will be heard
your voices will be heard




we crossed the line
who pushed who over
it doesnt matter to you
it matters to me

were cut adrift
but still floating
im only hanging on
to watch you go down
my love

i disappeared in you
you disappeared from me
i gave you everything you ever wanted
it wasnt what you wanted

the men who love you you hate the most
they pass right through you like a ghost
they look for you but your spirit is in the air
baby youre nowhere

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

desperation is a tender trap
it gets you every time
you put your lips to her lips
to stop the lie

her skin is pale like gods only dove
screams like an angel for your love
then she makes you watch her from above
and you need her like a drug

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

she wears my love like a seethrough dress
her lips say one thing
her movements something else
oh lovelike a screaming flower
lovedying every hourlove

you dont know if its fear or desire
danger the drug that takes you higher
head in heaven fingers in the mire

her heart is racing you cant keep up
the night is bleeding like a cut
between the horses of love and lust
we are trampled underfoot 

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

ohloveto stay with you id be a fool
sweetheartyoure so cruel

a world in white gets underway

we can be one

and gold is the reason for the wars we wage

theres an old tale wrought with the mystery of tom
the poet and his muse
and the magic lake which gave a life
to the words the poet used

now the muse she was his happiness
and he rhymed about her grace
and told her stories of treasures deep
beneath the blackened waves

till in the stillness of one dawn
still in its mystic crown
the muse she went down to the lake
and in the waves she drowned

and now to see your love set free
you will need the witchs cabin key
find the lady of the light gone mad with the night
thats how you reshape destiny

the poet came down to the lake
to call out to his dear
when there was no answer
he was overcome with fear

he searched in vain for his treasure lost
and too soon the night would fall
and only his own echo
would wail back at his call

and when he swore to bring back his love
by the stories hed create
nightmares shifted in their sleep
in the darkness of the lake

and now to see your love set free
you will need the witchs cabin key
find the lady of the light still ravin in the night
thats how you reshape destiny

in the dead of night she came to him
with darkness in her eyes
wearing a mourning gown
sweet words as her disguise

he took her in without a word
for he saw his grave mistake
and vowed them both to silence
deep beneath the lake

now if its real or just a dream
one mystery remains
for it is said on moonless nights
they may still haunt this place

and now to see your love set free
you will need the witchs cabin key
find the lady of the light gone mad with the night
thats how you reshape destiny

and now to see your love set free
you will need the witchs cabin key
find the lady of the light still ravin in the night
thats how you reshape destiny




ive exposed your lies baby 
the underneath is no big surprise 
now its time for changing 
and cleansing everything 
to forget your love

my plug in baby 
crucifies my enemies 
when im tired of giving 
my plug in baby 
in unbroken virgin realities 
is tired of living

dont confuse 
baby youre gonna lose 
your own game 
change me 
replace the envying 
to forget your love

my plug in baby 
crucifies my enemies 
when im tired of giving 
my plug in baby 
in unbroken virgin realities 
im tired of living

and ive seen your loving 
but mine is gone 
and ive been in trouble




is our secret safe tonight
and are we out of sight
or will our world come tumbling down
will they find our hiding place
is this our last embrace
or will the walls start caving in

it could be wrong could be wrong but it should have been right
it could be wrong could be wrong to let our hearts ignite
it could be wrong could be wrong are we digging a hole
it could be wrong could be wrong this is out of control

it could be wrong could be wrong it could never last
it could be wrong could be wrong must erase it fast
it could be wrong could be wrong but it could have been right
it could be wrong could be

love is our resistance
theyll keep us apart and they wont stop breaking us down
hold me
our lips must always be sealed

if we live a life in fear
ill wait a thousand years
just to see you smile again

kill your prayers for love and peace
youll wake the thought police
we cant hide the truth inside

it could be wrong could be wrong but it should have been right
it could be wrong could be wrong to let our hearts ignite
it could be wrong could be wrong are we digging a hole

it could be wrong could be wrong this is out of control
it could be wrong could be wrong it could never last
it could be wrong could be wrong must erase it fast
it could be wrong could be wrong but it could have been right
it could be wrong could be

love is our resistance
theyll keep us apart and they wont stop breaking us down
hold me
our lips must always be sealed

the night has reached its end
we cant pretend
we must run
we must run
its time to run
take us away from here
protect us from further harm
resistance




oh baby dont you know i suffer
oh baby cant you hear me moan
you caught me under false pretenses
how long before you let me go

ooh you set my soul alight

i want to find this girl i know
i need to take her out
ill set a snare in evening air
made of faith and hope and doubt

i want to spend some time with her
learn the secrets of her trade
i wouldnt mean to cross the line
and look into the other side
forbidden to my kind
forbidden to my kind

i need to hangout with my love
the raven headed sprite
i know ill never dance like her
or keep her up at night

i need to hang around with her
i need to let her know
her cause is mine im but a slave
i look into her wondrous gaze
and taste the strangest chord
and make the purest noise

what i would do to meet the girl
id stand out in the rain
outside my window watching close
she will appear again
still polishing her crazy nails
still wispy careless drunk on song
if i could only right my wrongs
and take her to my favourite place
and steal a melody
cause i need only see her face
and doubts and worries fall away
and music rushes in

listen to the sound of life
i dont want to be friends
drink deep of the day
i dont need your advance
wait for her but dont obsess
why do you have to ask
shell go the other way
no i dont want to dance

winds will blow and storms will rage
but your phrases are poor
the news is always sad
and you try hard to rhyme
money tends to disappear
and i cant read your words
beauty crumbles with the years
but i can read your mind
but music is for us
music is for us
music is for us
music is for us

what i would do to meet the girl
id stand out in the rain
outside my window watching close
she will appear again
still polishing her crazy nails
still wispy careless drunk on song
if i could only right my wrongs
and take her to my favourite place
and steal a melody
cause i need only see her face
and doubts and worries fall away
and music rushes in

if i could only see her face
and know that she was close
there is a deeper magic here
the everlasting muse
i left the danger for an hour
i left the sadness for a day
i know that i am in safe hands
she pays the bill and smokes cigars
and on the napkin silk
she weaves a manuscript with skill
an   middle 8
a tapestry of words

a subtle gift to modern rock
she says be popular play pop
and you will win my love
a subtle gift to modern rock
she says be popular play pop
and you will win my love

black muse can eye talk to you
what eye got to share is mighty good news
a brand new day is dawning
but you and me know what to do
so much work to do

black muse weve been so abused
our mothers were goodlooking and our fathers were to
but if they dont stay together
we cant walk no better in these shoes
black muse

long ago 2 men held one of us down
another took a whip and made a terrible sound
baby watched her father falling down to the ground
that was you and me

black muse can eye share with you
just came this morning and its mighty good news
they tipped the hour glass
now everything is passed
its true

they gave the world back to you and me
the faces on the mountains and a dirty sea
a trillion dollar bill and no currency
still we believe

black muse we gonna make it thru
surly people that created rhythm and blues
rock and roll and jazz
so you know were built to last
its cool its cool its cool
black muse

a new day is dawning
black muse
a new day is dawning
black muse

now that eye got your attention
eye think its bout time eye mention
the reason why eye wrote this song
like a ufo sighting
from my heart eye am writing
the next close encounter
tell me how long
will it be on land or near the water
will it produce the sun or the black moon daughter
or a pillow covered with all our tears
1000 light years away from here
1000 light years from here

no yesterday or tomorrow
no better remedy for sorrow
or why the 5th held forever will make you cry
eye dont know why

1000 light years from here
1000 light years from here

2 unbroken circles joined together make a butterfly
little darling dont you wanna try yeah i wanna try
there aint nothing better than looking for me for me to
and seeing you seeing me
seeing you in the mirror
1000 light years away from here

why do we always seem so far away
when you know that eye really wanna be with you night and day
im running out of ways to say how
so eye think ill just close
for now




is it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you now 
you got someone to blame
you say

one love
one life
when its one need
in the night
one love
we get to share it
leaves you baby if you 
dont care for it

did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without
well its

too late
tonight
to drag the past out into the light
were one but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other
one

have you come here for forgiveness
have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head

did i ask too much
more than a lot
you gave me nothing
now its all i got
were one
but were not the same
well we 
hurt each other
then we do it again
you say
love is a temple
love a higher law
love is a temple
love the higher law
you ask me to enter
but then you make me crawl
and i cant be holding on
to what you got
when all you got is hurt

one love
one blood
one life
you got to do what you should
one life
with each other
sisters
brothers
one life
but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other

onelife

one




the heart is a bloom
shoots up through the stony ground
theres no room
no space to rent in this town

youre out of luck
and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck
and youre not moving anywhere

you thought youd found a friend
to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand
in return for grace

its a beautiful day
sky falls you feel like
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away

youre on the road
but youve got no destination
youre in the mud
in the maze of her imagination

you love this town
even if that doesnt ring true
youve been all over
and its been all over you

its a beautiful day
dont let it get away
its a beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
teach me
i know im not a hopeless case

see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light
and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colors came out

it was a beautiful day
dont let it get away
beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
reach me
i know im not a hopeless case

what you dont have you dont need it now
what you dont know you can feel it somehow
what you dont have you dont need it now
dont need it now
was a beautiful day




im not afraid
of anything in this world
theres nothing you can throw at me
that i havent already heard

im just trying to find
a decent melody
a song that i can sing
in my own company

i never thought you were a fool
but darling look at you
you gotta stand up straight
carry your own weight
these tears are going nowhere baby

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and now you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i will not forsake
the colors that you bring
the nights you filled with fireworks
they left you with nothing

i am still enchanted
by the light you brought to me
i listen through your ears
through your eyes i can see

and you are such a fool
to worry like you do
i know its tough
and you can never get enough
of what you dont really need now
my oh my

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

oh love look at you now
youve got yourself stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i was unconscious half asleep
the water is warm til you discover how deep

i wasnt jumping for me it was a fall
its a long way down to nothing at all

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if our way should falter
along the stony pass

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if your way should falter
along this stony pass

its just a moment
this time will pass




youve got a face not spoiled by beauty
i have some scars from where ive been
youve got eyes that can see right through me
youre not afraid of anything theyve seen

i was told that i would feel
nothing the first time
i dont know how these cuts heal
but in you i found a right

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
that we shouldnt doubt
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

you let me into a conversation
a conversation only we could make
youre breaking into my imagination
whatevers in there is yours to take

i was told id feel
nothing the first time
you were slow to heal
but this could be the night

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
within and without
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

and im a long way
from your hill on calvary
and im a long way
from where i was where i need to be

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a kiss
i stole from your mouth
and there is a light
dont let it go out




the sea wants to kiss the golden shore
the sunlight warms your skin
all the beauty thats been lost before
wants to find us again

i cant fight you anymore
its you im fighting for
the sea throws rocks together
but time leaves us polished stones

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

birds fly high in the summer sky
and rest on the breeze
the same wind will take care of you and i
well build our house in the trees

your heart is on my sleeve
did you put it there with a magic marker
for years i would believe
that the world couldnt wash it away

cause we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

are we tough enough
for ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love




yes

i cant believe the news today
oh i cant close my eyes 
and make it go away
how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonight

broken bottles under childrens feet
bodies strewn across the dead end street
but i wont heed the battle call
it puts my back up
puts my back up against the wall

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

and the battles just begun
theres many lost but tell me who has won
the trench is dug within our hearts
and mothers children brothers sisters 
torn apart

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonighttonight 

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

wipe the tears from your eyes
wipe your tears away
oh wipe your tears away
oh wipe your tears away
sunday bloody sunday
oh wipe your blood shot eyes
sunday bloody sunday

sunday bloody sunday sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday sunday bloody sunday

and its true we are immune
when fact is fiction and tv reality
and today the millions cry
we eat and drink while tomorrow they die

sunday bloody sunday

the real battle just begun
to claim the victory jesus won
on

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

a time to turn your eyes away

a time for cutting hair 
is there a time for high street shopping 
to find the right dress to wear

to take her crown 

is there a time to walk for cover 
a time for kiss and tell 
is there a time for different colors 
different names you find it hard to spell 

is there a time for first communion 
a time for east 17 
is there a time to turn the mecca 
is there a time to be a beauty queen 

here she comes 
beauty plays the crown 
here she comes 
surreal in her crown

uno dos tres catorce
spoken vocal
turn it up loud captain

lights go down it’s dark
the jungle is your head  can’t rule your heart
a feeling is so much stronger than

and though your soul it can’t be bought
your mind can wonder

it’s everything i wish i didn’t know
except you give me something
i can feel feel

the night is full of holes
as bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
they twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
they know that they can’t dance  at least they know

i can’t stand the beats
i’m asking for the cheque
the girl with crimson nails
has jesus round her neck
swinging to the music  whoooaaa

every breaking wave on the shore
tells the next one therell be one more
and every gambler knows that to lose
is what youre really there for

summer i was fearless
now i speak into an answer phone
like every fallen leaf on the breeze
winter wouldnt leave it alone alone


if you go
if you go your way and i go mine
are we so
are we so helpless against the tide
baby every dog on the street
knows that were in love with defeat
are we ready to be swept off our feet
and stop chasing every breaking wave

every sailor knows that the sea
is a friend made enemy
every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
to live without intimacy

i thought i heard the captains voice
but its hard to listen while you preach
like every broken wave on the shore
this is as far as i could reach



the sea knows where are the rocks
and drowning is no sin
you know where my heart is
the same place that yours has been
we know that we fear to win
and so we end before we begin
before we begin






my love throws me like a rubber ball
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
she wont catch me or break my fall
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
babys got blue skies up ahead
but in this im a rain cloud
you know she likes a dry kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

im losing you
im losing you yeah
aint love the sweetest thing

i wanted to run but she made me crawl
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
eternal fire she turned me to straw
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
you know i got black eyes
but they burn so brightly for her
this is a blind kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

im losing you
oh oh oh im losing you
aint love the sweetest thing

blueeyed boy meets a browneyed girl
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
you can sew it up but you still see the tear
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
babys got blue skies up ahead
but in this im a rain cloud
ours is a stormy kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

green light seven eleven 
you stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
you dont smoke dont even want to 
hey now check your change 
dressed up like a car crash 
your wheels are turning but youre upside down 
you say when he hits you you dont mind 
because when he hurts you you feel alive 
hey babe is that what it is 

red lights gray morning 
you stumble out of a hole in the ground 
a vampire or a victim 
it depends on whos around 
you used to stay in to watch the adverts 
you could lip synch to the talk shows 

and if you look you look through me 
and when you talk you talk at me 
and when i touch you you dont feel a thing 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
stayand the day would keep its trust 
stayand the night would be enough 

faraway so close 
up with the static and the radio 
with satelite television 
you can go anywhere 
miami new orleans 
london belfast and berlin 

and if you listen i cant call 
and if you jump you just might fall 
and if you shout ill only hear you 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
staythen the day would keep its trust 
staywith the demons you drowned 
staywith the spirit i found 
stayand the night would be enough 

three oclock in the morning 
its quiet and theres no one around 
just the bang and the clatter 
as an angel runs to ground 

just the bang 
and the clatter 
as an angel 
hits the ground

you dont have to go it alone

and its you when i look in the mirror
and its you when i dont pick up the phone
sometimes you cant make it on your own

i know that we dont talk
im sick of it all
can  you  hear  me  when  i 
sing youre the reason i sing
youre the reason why the opera is in me

where are we now
ive still got to let you know
a house still doesnt make a home
dont leave me here alone

and its you when i look in the mirror
and its you that makes it hard to let go
sometimes you cant make it on your own
sometimes you cant make it
the best you can do is to fake it
sometimes you cant make it on your own




and love is not the easy thing
the only baggage
that you can bring
and love is not the easy thing
the only baggage you can bring
is all that you cant leave behind

and if the darkness is to keep us apart
and if the daylight feels like its a long way off
and if your glass heart should crack
and for a second you turn back
oh no be strong

walk on
walk on
what you got they cant steal it
no they cant even feel it

walk on
walk on
stay safe tonight

youre packing a suitcase for a place
none of us has been
a place that has to be believed
to be seen

you could have flown away
a singing bird
in an open cage
who will only fly
only fly for freedom

walk on
walk on
what you got
they cant deny it
cant sell it or buy it

walk on
walk on
stay safe tonight

and i know it aches
how your heart it breaks
and you can only take so much

walk on
walk on

home
hard to know what it is
if you never had one

home
i cant say where it is
but i know im going

home
thats where the hurt is

and i know it aches
and your heart it breaks
and you can only take so much
walk on

leave it behind
youve got to leave it behind

all that you fashion
all that you make
all that you build
all that you break

all that you measure
all that you steal
all this you can leave behind

all that you reason
all that you care

its only time
and ill never fill up all my mind 

all that you sense
all that you speak
all you dress up
and all that you scheme

all you create
all that you wreck
all that you hate




 1
i was chasing down the days of fear
chasing down a dream before it disappeared
i was aching to be somewhere near
your voice was all i heard
i was shaking from a storm in me
haunted by the spectres that we had to see
yeah i wanted to be the melody
above the noise above the hurt


i was young
not dumb
just wishing to be blinded
by you
brand new
and we were pilgrims on our way


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
heard a song that made some sense out of the world
everything i ever lost now has been returned
in the most beautiful sound id ever heard

 2
we got language so we cant communicate
religion so i can love and hate
music so i can exaggerate my pain and give it a name


i was young
not dumb
just wishing to be blinded
by you
brand new
and we were pilgrims on our way


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
heard a song that made some sense out of the world
everything i ever lost now has been returned
in the most beautiful sound id ever heard

bridge
we can hear you
we can hear you
we can hear you


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
i get so many things i dont deserve
all the stolen voices will someday be returned
the most beautiful sound id ever heard


your voices will be heard
your voices will be heard




we crossed the line
who pushed who over
it doesnt matter to you
it matters to me

were cut adrift
but still floating
im only hanging on
to watch you go down
my love

i disappeared in you
you disappeared from me
i gave you everything you ever wanted
it wasnt what you wanted

the men who love you you hate the most
they pass right through you like a ghost
they look for you but your spirit is in the air
baby youre nowhere

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

desperation is a tender trap
it gets you every time
you put your lips to her lips
to stop the lie

her skin is pale like gods only dove
screams like an angel for your love
then she makes you watch her from above
and you need her like a drug

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

she wears my love like a seethrough dress
her lips say one thing
her movements something else
oh lovelike a screaming flower
lovedying every hourlove

you dont know if its fear or desire
danger the drug that takes you higher
head in heaven fingers in the mire

her heart is racing you cant keep up
the night is bleeding like a cut
between the horses of love and lust
we are trampled underfoot 

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

ohloveto stay with you id be a fool
sweetheartyoure so cruel




yeah

all is quiet on new years day
a world in white gets underway
i want to be with you
be with you night and day
nothing changes on new years day
on new years day

i will be with you again
i will be with you again

under a blood red sky
a crowd has gathered in black and white
arms entwined the chosen few
the newspapers says says 
say its true its true
and we can break through
though torn in two 
we can be one

ii will begin again
ii will begin again

oh
maybe the time is right
ohmaybe tonight

i will be with you again
i will be with you again

and so were told this is the golden age
and gold is the reason for the wars we wage
though i want to be with you
be with you night and day
nothing changes 
on new years day
on new years day




somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

you think it’s easier
to put your finger on the trouble
when the trouble is you
and you think it’s easier
to know your own tricks
well it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do

i have a will for survival
so you can hurt me and hurt me some more
i can live with denial
but you’re not my troubles anymore

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till somebody else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

you think it’s easier
to give up on the trouble
if the trouble is destroying you
you think it’s easier
but before you threw me a rope
it was the one thing i could hold on to

i have a will for survival
so you can hurt me then hurt me some more
i can live with denial
but you’re not my troubles anymore

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

god knows it’s not easy
taking on the shape of someone else’s pain
god now you can see me
i’m naked and i’m not afraid
my body’s sacred and i’m not ashamed

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control




is it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you now 
you got someone to blame
you say

one love
one life
when its one need
in the night
one love
we get to share it
leaves you baby if you 
dont care for it

did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without
well its

too late
tonight
to drag the past out into the light
were one but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other
one

have you come here for forgiveness
have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head

did i ask too much
more than a lot
you gave me nothing
now its all i got
were one
but were not the same
well we 
hurt each other
then we do it again
you say
love is a temple
love a higher law
love is a temple
love the higher law
you ask me to enter
but then you make me crawl
and i cant be holding on
to what you got
when all you got is hurt

one love
one blood
one life
you got to do what you should
one life
with each other
sisters
brothers
one life
but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other

onelife

one




the heart is a bloom
shoots up through the stony ground
theres no room
no space to rent in this town

youre out of luck
and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck
and youre not moving anywhere

you thought youd found a friend
to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand
in return for grace

its a beautiful day
sky falls you feel like
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away

youre on the road
but youve got no destination
youre in the mud
in the maze of her imagination

you love this town
even if that doesnt ring true
youve been all over
and its been all over you

its a beautiful day
dont let it get away
its a beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
teach me
i know im not a hopeless case

see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light
and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colors came out

it was a beautiful day
dont let it get away
beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
reach me
i know im not a hopeless case

what you dont have you dont need it now
what you dont know you can feel it somehow
what you dont have you dont need it now
dont need it now
was a beautiful day




im not afraid
of anything in this world
theres nothing you can throw at me
that i havent already heard

im just trying to find
a decent melody
a song that i can sing
in my own company

i never thought you were a fool
but darling look at you
you gotta stand up straight
carry your own weight
these tears are going nowhere baby

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and now you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i will not forsake
the colors that you bring
the nights you filled with fireworks
they left you with nothing

i am still enchanted
by the light you brought to me
i listen through your ears
through your eyes i can see

and you are such a fool
to worry like you do
i know its tough
and you can never get enough
of what you dont really need now
my oh my

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

oh love look at you now
youve got yourself stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i was unconscious half asleep
the water is warm til you discover how deep

i wasnt jumping for me it was a fall
its a long way down to nothing at all

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if our way should falter
along the stony pass

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if your way should falter
along this stony pass

its just a moment
this time will pass




youve got a face not spoiled by beauty
i have some scars from where ive been
youve got eyes that can see right through me
youre not afraid of anything theyve seen

i was told that i would feel
nothing the first time
i dont know how these cuts heal
but in you i found a right

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
that we shouldnt doubt
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

you let me into a conversation
a conversation only we could make
youre breaking into my imagination
whatevers in there is yours to take

i was told id feel
nothing the first time
you were slow to heal
but this could be the night

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
within and without
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

and im a long way
from your hill on calvary
and im a long way
from where i was where i need to be

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a kiss
i stole from your mouth
and there is a light
dont let it go out




the sea wants to kiss the golden shore
the sunlight warms your skin
all the beauty thats been lost before
wants to find us again

i cant fight you anymore
its you im fighting for
the sea throws rocks together
but time leaves us polished stones

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

birds fly high in the summer sky
and rest on the breeze
the same wind will take care of you and i
well build our house in the trees

your heart is on my sleeve
did you put it there with a magic marker
for years i would believe
that the world couldnt wash it away

cause we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

are we tough enough
for ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love




yes

i cant believe the news today
oh i cant close my eyes 
and make it go away
how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonight

broken bottles under childrens feet
bodies strewn across the dead end street
but i wont heed the battle call
it puts my back up
puts my back up against the wall

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

and the battles just begun
theres many lost but tell me who has won
the trench is dug within our hearts
and mothers children brothers sisters 
torn apart

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonighttonight

oh wipe your tears away
oh wipe your tears away
sunday bloody sunday
oh wipe your blood shot eyes

and its true we are immune
when fact is fiction and tv reality
and today the millions cry
we eat and drink while tomorrow they die

to claim the victory jesus won

is there a time to be a beauty queen 

here she comes 
beauty plays the crown 
here she comes

uno dos tres catorce

it’s everything i wish i didn’t know
except you give me something

the night is full of holes
as bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
they twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
they know that they can’t dance  at least they know

i can’t stand the beats
i’m asking for the cheque
the girl with crimson nails
has jesus round her neck
swinging to the music  whoooaaa

every breaking wave on the shore
tells the next one therell be one more
and every gambler knows that to lose
is what youre really there for

summer i was fearless
now i speak into an answer phone
like every fallen leaf on the breeze
winter wouldnt leave it alone alone


if you go
if you go your way and i go mine
are we so
are we so helpless against the tide
baby every dog on the street
knows that were in love with defeat
are we ready to be swept off our feet
and stop chasing every breaking wave

every sailor knows that the sea
is a friend made enemy
every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
to live without intimacy

i thought i heard the captains voice
but its hard to listen while you preach
like every broken wave on the shore
this is as far as i could reach



the sea knows where are the rocks
and drowning is no sin
you know where my heart is
the same place that yours has been
we know that we fear to win
and so we end before we begin
before we begin






my love throws me like a rubber ball
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
she wont catch me or break my fall
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
babys got blue skies up ahead
but in this im a rain cloud
you know she likes a dry kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

im losing you
im losing you yeah
aint love the sweetest thing

i wanted to run but she made me crawl
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
eternal fire she turned me to straw
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
you know i got black eyes
but they burn so brightly for her
this is a blind kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

im losing you
oh oh oh im losing you
aint love the sweetest thing

blueeyed boy meets a browneyed girl
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
you can sew it up but you still see the tear
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
babys got blue skies up ahead
but in this im a rain cloud
ours is a stormy kind of love
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

green light seven eleven 
you stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
you dont smoke dont even want to 
hey now check your change 
dressed up like a car crash 
your wheels are turning but youre upside down 
you say when he hits you you dont mind 
because when he hurts you you feel alive 
hey babe is that what it is 

red lights gray morning 
you stumble out of a hole in the ground 
a vampire or a victim 
it depends on whos around 
you used to stay in to watch the adverts 
you could lip synch to the talk shows 

and if you look you look through me 
and when you talk you talk at me 
and when i touch you you dont feel a thing 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
stayand the day would keep its trust 
stayand the night would be enough 

faraway so close 
up with the static and the radio 
with satelite television 
you can go anywhere 
miami new orleans 
london belfast and berlin 

and if you listen i cant call 
and if you jump you just might fall 
and if you shout ill only hear you 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
staythen the day would keep its trust 
staywith the demons you drowned 
staywith the spirit i found 
stayand the night would be enough 

three oclock in the morning 
its quiet and theres no one around 
just the bang and the clatter 
as an angel runs to ground 

just the bang 
and the clatter 
as an angel 
hits the ground

and its you when i look in the mirror
and its you that makes it hard to let go
sometimes you cant make it on your own

the best you can do is to fake it
sometimes you cant make it on your own

 1
i was chasing down the days of fear
chasing down a dream before it disappeared
i was aching to be somewhere near
your voice was all i heard
i was shaking from a storm in me
haunted by the spectres that we had to see
yeah i wanted to be the melody
above the noise above the hurt


i was young
not dumb
just wishing to be blinded
by you
brand new
and we were pilgrims on our way


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
heard a song that made some sense out of the world
everything i ever lost now has been returned
in the most beautiful sound id ever heard

 2
we got language so we cant communicate
religion so i can love and hate
music so i can exaggerate my pain and give it a name


i was young
not dumb
just wishing to be blinded
by you
brand new
and we were pilgrims on our way


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
heard a song that made some sense out of the world
everything i ever lost now has been returned
in the most beautiful sound id ever heard

bridge
we can hear you
we can hear you
we can hear you


i woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
i get so many things i dont deserve
all the stolen voices will someday be returned
the most beautiful sound id ever heard


your voices will be heard
your voices will be heard




we crossed the line
who pushed who over
it doesnt matter to you
it matters to me

were cut adrift
but still floating
im only hanging on
to watch you go down
my love

i disappeared in you
you disappeared from me
i gave you everything you ever wanted
it wasnt what you wanted

the men who love you you hate the most
they pass right through you like a ghost
they look for you but your spirit is in the air
baby youre nowhere

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

desperation is a tender trap
it gets you every time
you put your lips to her lips
to stop the lie

her skin is pale like gods only dove
screams like an angel for your love
then she makes you watch her from above
and you need her like a drug

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

she wears my love like a seethrough dress
her lips say one thing
her movements something else
oh lovelike a screaming flower
lovedying every hourlove

you dont know if its fear or desire
danger the drug that takes you higher
head in heaven fingers in the mire

her heart is racing you cant keep up
the night is bleeding like a cut
between the horses of love and lust
we are trampled underfoot 

ohloveyou say in love there are no rules
ohlovesweetheart
youre so cruel

ohloveto stay with you id be a fool
sweetheartyoure so cruel




yeah

all is quiet on new years day
a world in white gets underway
i want to be with you
be with you night and day
nothing changes on new years day
on new years day

i will be with you again
i will be with you again

under a blood red sky
a crowd has gathered in black and white
arms entwined the chosen few
the newspapers says says 
say its true its true
and we can break through
though torn in two 
we can be one

ii will begin again
ii will begin again

oh
maybe the time is right
ohmaybe tonight

i will be with you again
i will be with you again

and so were told this is the golden age
and gold is the reason for the wars we wage
though i want to be with you
be with you night and day
nothing changes 
on new years day
on new years day




somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

you think it’s easier
to put your finger on the trouble
when the trouble is you
and you think it’s easier
to know your own tricks
well it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do

i have a will for survival
so you can hurt me and hurt me some more
i can live with denial
but you’re not my troubles anymore

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till somebody else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

you think it’s easier
to give up on the trouble
if the trouble is destroying you
you think it’s easier
but before you threw me a rope
it was the one thing i could hold on to

i have a will for survival
so you can hurt me then hurt me some more
i can live with denial
but you’re not my troubles anymore

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

god knows it’s not easy
taking on the shape of someone else’s pain
god now you can see me
i’m naked and i’m not afraid
my body’s sacred and i’m not ashamed

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

mandy moore

just how blind ive been
now im here blinking in the starlight
now im here suddenly i see
standing here its all so clear
im where im meant to be

mandy moore
and at last i see the light
and its like the fog has lifted
and at last i see the light
and its like the sky is new
and its warm and real and bright
and the world has somehow shifted
all at once everything looks different
now that i see you

zachary levi

all those years living in a blur

and at last i see the light

zachary levi

is it time

look i spent my whole life trying to improvise
im not saying that shit for you to sympathize
spent my whole life trying to find whats at the end of the tunnel
i should have realized it was inside
so lately i been trying to get whats inside outside
so many people wanna see my insides outside
im from that city four hours east of southside
where everyone outside but dont fuck with no outsiders
growing up with the ones i hold it down with
whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
whole city blowing up on some old saddam shit
before this i was the one hoes tried to go to prom with
you know take the fame take the crib
take our cars now we gotta take the train
hood niggas takin chains slave master take our names
50 take the shot young souls take the blame
man but they cant take away the light

no matter how much they gon shade you no
man they cant fuck with the light
they cant stop the shine
they cant fuck with the light hell nah the boys that bright
even if you take away my life you cant take the light
no matter how much they gon shade you

got the whole city on fire
boy this the flow that got steph curry inspired
this the flow that got lebron james finna rewire
this the flow that got my whole family finna retire
flows on flows i might drown in this bitch
ye found a pro i guess im profound in this bitch
my dad from louisiana man the smallest town
where if they know you brown they might hold you down
and even hose you down man
since im a son i feel like i gotta stunt hard
i took the hand that they gave me and played the donald trump card
and realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
and a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
so when they take the fame take the crib
take our cars now we gotta take the train
hood niggas takin chains slave master take our names
50 take the shot and young souls take the blame
man but they cant take away the light

no matter how much they gon shade you nah
man they cant fuck with the light
they cant stop the shine
they cant fuck with the light hell nah the boys that bright
even if you take away my life you cant take the light
no matter how much they gon shade you
dont let them take away your soul no no
dont let them take away what makes you whole




son your fathers not all good
still i love you more than i thought i could

and when the menace in my mind
finds me i simply look to your eyes

and boy someday i hope i do
see the man you will grow into
and when you hearts in disarray
know that your father too has made mistakes

son your fathers lost his head
still i mean every word that ive said

though the truth can truly cut
here in this confessional with my blood

boy someday i hope i do
see the man you will grow into
and when you hearts in disarray
know that your father too has made mistakes

ive been cruel to the ones who have stayed by my side
and foolish enough to believe in my pride
but vanity never could keep me from caring for you

ive strayed too far away from the trees and the lake
the innocent road that i chose not to take
but still i can bring you to bathe in the river
to wash out the world long before your hearts withered away

boy someday i hope i do
see the man you will grow into
and when you hearts in disarray
know that your father too has made hes made mistakes

i gave my cards away would lose the game for you
each second slipped away did not know what to do
was always drawing secrets on your wall
my clothes were always falling on your floor

a reckless heart could never be much more
i always snuck in late
running through the front gate

light floating on a feather
light landing on forever
light

our trip surreal so high
we flew right through the roof
those nights you never came home
i stayed up needing you
was always writing poems in math books
my idols were the clever fast crooks

this reckless heart could never be much more
i always snuck in late
rushing through the front gate

light floating on a feather
light landing on forever

float on a feather land on forever 
float on a feather land on forever




your eyes they opened
and love was spoken
the tears came tumbling down

your heart was broken
the words were spoken
the tears came tumbling down

and the blind gained sight
as we met our light
oh the joy and fight
the gift of life

your hands the creases
your feet your breathing
you’re mine you’re perfect light

and the blind gained sight
as we met our light
oh the joy and fight
the gift of life

i can’t take my eyes off of you oh my light
i can’t take my eyes off of you




take my hand
and walk in the light
understand theres a fire to ignite
you know we have a responsibility
its true weve been chosen
and now we have the possibility
of melting whats frozen

walk with me with the rapture inside
cant you see its not our place to decide
you know we have to make a case for love
its more of a duty
its clear we have a mission from above
a mission of beauty

you know i wouldnt lie to you
what would i achieve by that
its more than i would try to do
these are the facts

take your place here
with love in your heart
just embrace what youve known from the start
we are fulfilling our only destiny
the angels have spoken
and all the gods in the uni agree
the spell cant be broken




i can see the light between me and my mind
i can feel memories fall behind
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

i see the future is less and less there
and the past has vanished in the air
and im left in the now with a wondrous glow
i think im still me but how would you know

i can see the light between me and my mind
i can feel memories fall behind
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

it takes a few moments of whirling around
till your feet finally leave the ground
and fending off fears and heeding the call
and finally waiting for nothing at all

i can see the light between me and my mind
i can feel memories fall behind
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now oh

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now




in sunshines view
the absence of love
behold whats blinding you
serpent or dove
between uncertainties
tethered wings and captive dreams arent worth the suffering

open your eyes
devotion deprived
deny the very thing that youve accepted this life is about
listen to my words
defy devotion
sick from the fall behind the wall
so i demand of you stand up and see

before they saw what i was becoming
before it kept me form reaching

the light
cant seem to understand it
cant seem to know
listen to the vacant soul
the child has lost his way

tension
suffering the hole
something against me
i wont try
never again
i will not remember
between the lines i sing with doubt
behind this will fall

lost in night and day
breathing for me
listen to the way i enter the world
in time this lie will become me

the things ive done to forget my dying senses
weary from this act alone
in vein six days away
return from the fall

just find a ray of light to help me ascend
that is the only way




jesus would you light my way
jesus would you light my way

in every word in every scene
to live for the one who died for me
what grace is this that saved my soul
my god my god i give it all


all i ever want is
all i ever need is you




divine inspiration
total disallusion
instant consecration
mind and body fusion
frontal assault on the seven senses
orgasmic waste
eccentric and pretentious

kmfdm doin it again
a treat for the freaks
truth or dare
are you ready for this
we dont care

in a world of deceipt
open your eyes
dont be afraid and you realize
what we do for you so good for you
what you do for me so good for me

deified dada
hard but true
godlike nonsense being thrown at you

we keep simple
tough and outright
easy to swallow
kmfdm light

one way or another
now or later
bow down and worship 
the true creator

musik ist macht
eine ausgesprochene verbindung von schlau und dumm
gerauschsuchtigen wird unter immensem druck und 
leidenschaft grosste freude und vertrauen abgesaugt
der helden riff ist der froschfresser
der rhythmus ein schoner schwan
nur die worte ein blutegel an deinem gehirn
keiner macht fur dich mehr

take a good plunge
stand out from the masses
bend over backwards and
kick some asses

call 1800
accept no imitations
kmfdm one world one nation




all i needed was a light
in the darkest place
ive ever been in all my life
as i try to find my way
and the changing seasons of my life
and my eyes dont see
the things i love have run their course
are they done
are they just beginning

and im old enough to know
that time doesnt move slow enough
and young enough to know
that i cant ever be too old enough to trust you
higher and higher
i wanna go there with you
some say your fire your fire
is through
and i dont wanna think that way

so you lost your job and lost the girl
and you crushed your soul
around you standing out of reach
before you know
so you wet your finger
hold it up
but theres no wind there
telling you where you where you should go
so you try try to trust 
while you bear it

and im old enough to know
that time doesnt move slow enough
and young enough to know
that i cant ever be too old enough to trust you
higher and higher
i wanna go there with you
some say your fire your fire
is through
but i dont

i am yours do what you wish
i am yours i am yours
and i know this
whatever happens next
is in your hands in your plans
nothing less
every day there is a choice
and through the joy
through the pain
i will rejoice
i am yours do what you wish
i am yours i am yours
and i know this

save me
cause i need it
and i cant help but feel desperate
my desires they seem 
were coming to their endings
but i will trust its not the end
but a great beginning




and i will be the lighthouse in your sea
thats guiding you home
and i will be the lamp unto your feet
when you roam

just cling to me
and ill set you free

i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your sight
i will be the light
when its all getting blurry and covering up your eyes
i will be the light
i will be the light

i will be the sun up in your sky
thats keeping you alive
i will be the headlights in your night
when you drive

just cling to me
and ill set you free

i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your sight
i will be the light
when its all getting blurry and covering up your eyes
i will be the light

i will be the light in your night
when you lose your way you lose your sight
i will be the light in your night
when you dont know which way to go
i will be the light in your night
when you lose your way you lose your sight oh

i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your sight
i will be the light
when its all getting blurry and covering up your eyes

and i will be the light
and i will be the light
and i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your eyes
i will be the light




fiery spider
candy stars in bloom
crystal fire fractures 
sparks into the room
shadow seams have opened
right inside the blaze to
catch the spinning
light
flaming river
burning in the skymay these words be the first
to find your ears
the world is brighter than the sun
now that you’re here
though your eyes will need some time to adjust
to the overwhelming light surrounding us

i’ll give you everything i have
i’ll teach you everything i know
i promise i’ll do better
i will always hold you close
but i will learn to let you go
i promise i’ll do better
i will soften every edge
i’ll hold the world to its best
and i’ll do better
with every heartbeat i have left
i will defend your every breath
and i’ll do better

’Сause you are loved
you are loved more than you know
i hereby pledge all of my days
to prove it so
though your heart is far too young to realize
the unimaginable light you hold inside

i’ll give you everything i have
i’ll teach you everything i know
i promise i’ll do better
i will always hold you close
but i will learn to let you go
i promise i’ll do better
i will rearrange the stars
pull ‘em down to where you are
i promise i’ll do better
with every heartbeat i have left
i’ll defend your every breath
i promise i’ll do better
i will soften every edge
hold the world to its best
i promise i’ll do better
with every heartbeat i have left
i’ll defend your every breath
i’ll do better

is it time

look i spent my whole life trying to improvise
im not saying that shit for you to sympathize
spent my whole life trying to find whats at the end of the tunnel
i should have realized it was inside
so lately i been trying to get whats inside outside
so many people wanna see my insides outside
im from that city four hours east of southside
where everyone outside but dont fuck with no outsiders
growing up with the ones i hold it down with
whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
whole city blowing up on some old saddam shit
before this i was the one hoes tried to go to prom with
you know take the fame take the crib
take our cars now we gotta take the train
hood niggas takin chains slave master take our names
50 take the shot young souls take the blame
man but they cant take away the light

no matter how much they gon shade you no
man they cant fuck with the light
they cant stop the shine
they cant fuck with the light hell nah the boys that bright
even if you take away my life you cant take the light
no matter how much they gon shade you

got the whole city on fire
boy this the flow that got steph curry inspired
this the flow that got lebron james finna rewire
this the flow that got my whole family finna retire
flows on flows i might drown in this bitch
ye found a pro i guess im profound in this bitch
my dad from louisiana man the smallest town
where if they know you brown they might hold you down
and even hose you down man
since im a son i feel like i gotta stunt hard
i took the hand that they gave me and played the donald trump card
and realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
and a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
so when they take the fame take the crib
take our cars now we gotta take the train
hood niggas takin chains slave master take our names
50 take the shot and young souls take the blame
man but they cant take away the light

no matter how much they gon shade you nah
man they cant fuck with the light
they cant stop the shine
they cant fuck with the light hell nah the boys that bright
even if you take away my life you cant take the light
no matter how much they gon shade you
dont let them take away your soul no no
dont let them take away what makes you whole

son your fathers not all good
still i love you more than i thought i could

and when the menace in my mind
finds me i simply look to your eyes

and boy someday i hope i do
see the man you will grow into
and when you hearts in disarray
know that your father too has made mistakes

son your fathers lost his head
still i mean every word that ive said

though the truth can truly cut
here in this confessional with my blood

boy someday i hope i do
see the man you will grow into
and when you hearts in disarray
know that your father too has made mistakes

ive been cruel to the ones who have stayed by my side
and foolish enough to believe in my pride
but vanity never could keep me from caring for you

ive strayed too far away from the trees and the lake
the innocent road that i chose not to take
but still i can bring you to bathe in the river
to wash out the world long before your hearts withered away

boy someday i hope i do
see the man you will grow into
and when you hearts in disarray
know that your father too has made hes made mistakes




why are you keeping me at a distance
all that im asking for is forgiveness
are you even listening am i talking to myself again
i keep on staring up at the ceiling
waiting for you to give me some kind of reason
are you even listening am i talking to myself again

and i know you dont owe me your love
and i know that you dont owe me nothing at all
aint no way im giving up on you

dont leave me here in the dark when its hard to see
show me your heart shed a light on me
if you love me say so if you love me say so
you know i cant live without you im on my knees
where are you now shed a light on me
if you love me say so if you love me say so

why when i call you never answer
ill try to talk you keep on dancing
i can feel you on my skin but am i only dancing with the wind

and i know you dont owe me your love
and i know that you dont owe me nothing at all
aint no way im giving up on you

dont leave me here in the dark when its hard to see
show me your heart shed a light on me
if you love me say so if you love me say so
if you love me say something
you know i cant live without you im on my knees
where are you now shed a light on me
if you love me say so if you love me say so

shed a light shed a light on me
shed a light shed a light on me
dont leave me here in the dark when its hard to see
show me your heart shed a light on me
if you love me say so if you love me say so




your eyes they opened
and love was spoken
the tears came tumbling down

your heart was broken
the words were spoken
the tears came tumbling down

and the blind gained sight
as we met our light
oh the joy and fight
the gift of life

your hands the creases
your feet your breathing
you’re mine you’re perfect light

and the blind gained sight
as we met our light
oh the joy and fight
the gift of life

i can’t take my eyes off of you oh my light
i can’t take my eyes off of you




in sunshines view
the absence of love
behold whats blinding you
serpent or dove
between uncertainties
tethered wings and captive dreams arent worth the suffering

open your eyes
devotion deprived
deny the very thing that youve accepted this life is about
listen to my words
defy devotion
sick from the fall behind the wall
so i demand of you stand up and see

before they saw what i was becoming
before it kept me form reaching

the light
cant seem to understand it
cant seem to know
listen to the vacant soul
the child has lost his way

tension
suffering the hole
something against me
i wont try
never again
i will not remember
between the lines i sing with doubt
behind this will fall

lost in night and day
breathing for me
listen to the way i enter the world
in time this lie will become me

the things ive done to forget my dying senses
weary from this act alone
in vein six days away
return from the fall

just find a ray of light to help me ascend
that is the only way




divine inspiration
total disallusion
instant consecration
mind and body fusion
frontal assault on the seven senses
orgasmic waste
eccentric and pretentious

kmfdm doin it again
a treat for the freaks
truth or dare
are you ready for this
we dont care

in a world of deceipt
open your eyes
dont be afraid and you realize
what we do for you so good for you
what you do for me so good for me

deified dada
hard but true
godlike nonsense being thrown at you

we keep simple
tough and outright
easy to swallow
kmfdm light

one way or another
now or later
bow down and worship 
the true creator

musik ist macht
eine ausgesprochene verbindung von schlau und dumm
gerauschsuchtigen wird unter immensem druck und 
leidenschaft grosste freude und vertrauen abgesaugt
der helden riff ist der froschfresser
der rhythmus ein schoner schwan
nur die worte ein blutegel an deinem gehirn
keiner macht fur dich mehr

take a good plunge
stand out from the masses
bend over backwards and
kick some asses

call 1800
accept no imitations
kmfdm one world one nation




take my hand
and walk in the light
understand theres a fire to ignite
you know we have a responsibility
its true weve been chosen
and now we have the possibility
of melting whats frozen

walk with me with the rapture inside
cant you see its not our place to decide
you know we have to make a case for love
its more of a duty
its clear we have a mission from above
a mission of beauty

you know i wouldnt lie to you
what would i achieve by that
its more than i would try to do
these are the facts

take your place here
with love in your heart
just embrace what youve known from the start
we are fulfilling our only destiny
the angels have spoken
and all the gods in the uni agree
the spell cant be broken




i gave my cards away would lose the game for you
each second slipped away did not know what to do
was always drawing secrets on your wall
my clothes were always falling on your floor

a reckless heart could never be much more
i always snuck in late
running through the front gate

light floating on a feather
light landing on forever
light

our trip surreal so high
we flew right through the roof
those nights you never came home
i stayed up needing you
was always writing poems in math books
my idols were the clever fast crooks

this reckless heart could never be much more
i always snuck in late
rushing through the front gate

light floating on a feather
light landing on forever

float on a feather land on forever 
float on a feather land on forever




the light it flickers
your light travelling down so deep
illumination

i have been cold i have been blind
you have come to change my mind
i can put my faith in you

the light it blisters
your light coming down so bright
transformation
turn it up give me some room to grow
turn it up give me that sense to know

i have been cold i have been blind
you were sent to change my mind
i can put my faith in you

for something ordinary
its so extraordinary
i trust i put my faith in you
in you
in you in you
in you in you

the light it glitters
your light when i stand this close
its almost blinding
turn it up give me some room to grow
turn it up give me the sense to know

i have been changed i have become
i have flamed under the sun
im the reflection of you

for something ordinary
its so extraordinary
i trust i put my faith in you
in you
in you in you
in you in you
in you you you

for something ordinary
its so extraordinary
i just i put my faith in you
in you
in you in you
in you you you

it flickers
it blisters
it glitters

in you in you
in you you you
you are




you are the one who brings the weather
you are a dream ive had forever
you know exactly what im wishing
youre gonna love me into submission

feelings i had
while at your feet
those kind of things
i cant repeat
youre gonna fill their world
with light

you put the point in exclamation
you took a day to build a nation
youre gonna teach me how to live
youre gonna teach me how to give

feelings i had
well who can say
i cant explain them
anyway
youre gonna fill their world
with light
youre gonna fill their world
with light




jesus would you light my way
jesus would you light my way

in every word in every scene
to live for the one who died for me
what grace is this that saved my soul
my god my god i give it all


all i ever want is
all i ever need is you




all i needed was a light
in the darkest place
ive ever been in all my life
as i try to find my way
and the changing seasons of my life
and my eyes dont see
the things i love have run their course
are they done
are they just beginning

and im old enough to know
that time doesnt move slow enough
and young enough to know
that i cant ever be too old enough to trust you
higher and higher
i wanna go there with you
some say your fire your fire
is through
and i dont wanna think that way

so you lost your job and lost the girl
and you crushed your soul
around you standing out of reach
before you know
so you wet your finger
hold it up
but theres no wind there
telling you where you where you should go
so you try try to trust 
while you bear it

and im old enough to know
that time doesnt move slow enough
and young enough to know
that i cant ever be too old enough to trust you
higher and higher
i wanna go there with you
some say your fire your fire
is through
but i dont

i am yours do what you wish
i am yours i am yours
and i know this
whatever happens next
is in your hands in your plans
nothing less
every day there is a choice
and through the joy
through the pain
i will rejoice
i am yours do what you wish
i am yours i am yours
and i know this

save me
cause i need it
and i cant help but feel desperate
my desires they seem 
were coming to their endings
but i will trust its not the end
but a great beginning




there comes a point in time where you have to decide
there’s no right way to do the wrong thing
but you got to do what your afraid to do
go where your afraid to go
and every time you runaway because your afraid to do something big
you let an opportunity pass you by
you see you can’t keep doing the same thing
over and over and expect different results
the normal has to be ignored
the ordinary discarded
and the routine must be feared
a fighter isn’t someone who never fails
a fighter is someone who never quits
you are not the down trotted but the uplifted
the head and not the tail
you really think he brought you this far
just to leave you now
dreaming isn’t a waste of time
the desire to get up and go again when everyone else has gone home
the perseverance to get up and go again
and the drive to see the dream fulfilled
you can’t be a man that doesn’t stop
get up




i can see the light between me and my mind
i can feel memories fall behind
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

i see the future is less and less there
and the past has vanished in the air
and im left in the now with a wondrous glow
i think im still me but how would you know

i can see the light between me and my mind
i can feel memories fall behind
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

it takes a few moments of whirling around
till your feet finally leave the ground
and fending off fears and heeding the call
and finally waiting for nothing at all

i can see the light between me and my mind
i can feel memories fall behind
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now oh

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now

and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now
and the light is growing brighter now




and i will be the lighthouse in your sea
thats guiding you home
and i will be the lamp unto your feet
when you roam

just cling to me
and ill set you free

i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your sight
i will be the light
when its all getting blurry and covering up your eyes
i will be the light
i will be the light

i will be the sun up in your sky
thats keeping you alive
i will be the headlights in your night
when you drive

just cling to me
and ill set you free

i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your sight
i will be the light
when its all getting blurry and covering up your eyes
i will be the light

i will be the light in your night
when you lose your way you lose your sight
i will be the light in your night
when you dont know which way to go
i will be the light in your night
when you lose your way you lose your sight oh

i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your sight
i will be the light
when its all getting blurry and covering up your eyes

and i will be the light
and i will be the light
and i will be the light
when the world is blinding out your eyes
i will be the light




is it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you now 
you got someone to blame
you say

one love
one life
when its one need
in the night
one love
we get to share it
leaves you baby if you 
dont care for it

did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without
well its

too late
tonight
to drag the past out into the light
were one but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other
one

have you come here for forgiveness
have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head

did i ask too much
more than a lot
you gave me nothing
now its all i got
were one
but were not the same
well we 
hurt each other
then we do it again
you say
love is a temple
love a higher law
love is a temple
love the higher law
you ask me to enter
but then you make me crawl
and i cant be holding on
to what you got
when all you got is hurt

one love
one blood
one life
you got to do what you should
one life
with each other
sisters
brothers
one life
but were not the same
we get to 
carry each other
carry each other

onelife

one




yes

i cant believe the news today
oh i cant close my eyes 
and make it go away
how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonight

broken bottles under childrens feet
bodies strewn across the dead end street
but i wont heed the battle call
it puts my back up
puts my back up against the wall

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

and the battles just begun
theres many lost but tell me who has won
the trench is dug within our hearts
and mothers children brothers sisters 
torn apart

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

how long
how long must we sing this song
how long how long
cause tonightwe can be as one
tonighttonight 

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday

wipe the tears from your eyes
wipe your tears away
oh wipe your tears away
oh wipe your tears away
sunday bloody sunday
oh wipe your blood shot eyes
sunday bloody sunday

sunday bloody sunday sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday sunday bloody sunday

and its true we are immune
when fact is fiction and tv reality
and today the millions cry
we eat and drink while tomorrow they die

sunday bloody sunday

the real battle just begun
to claim the victory jesus won
on

sunday bloody sunday
sunday bloody sunday




im not afraid
of anything in this world
theres nothing you can throw at me
that i havent already heard

im just trying to find
a decent melody
a song that i can sing
in my own company

i never thought you were a fool
but darling look at you
you gotta stand up straight
carry your own weight
these tears are going nowhere baby

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and now you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i will not forsake
the colors that you bring
the nights you filled with fireworks
they left you with nothing

i am still enchanted
by the light you brought to me
i listen through your ears
through your eyes i can see

and you are such a fool
to worry like you do
i know its tough
and you can never get enough
of what you dont really need now
my oh my

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

oh love look at you now
youve got yourself stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

i was unconscious half asleep
the water is warm til you discover how deep

i wasnt jumping for me it was a fall
its a long way down to nothing at all

youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if our way should falter
along the stony pass

and if the night runs over
and if the day wont last
and if your way should falter
along this stony pass

its just a moment
this time will pass




the heart is a bloom
shoots up through the stony ground
theres no room
no space to rent in this town

youre out of luck
and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck
and youre not moving anywhere

you thought youd found a friend
to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand
in return for grace

its a beautiful day
sky falls you feel like
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away

youre on the road
but youve got no destination
youre in the mud
in the maze of her imagination

you love this town
even if that doesnt ring true
youve been all over
and its been all over you

its a beautiful day
dont let it get away
its a beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
teach me
i know im not a hopeless case

see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light
and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colors came out

it was a beautiful day
dont let it get away
beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
reach me
i know im not a hopeless case

what you dont have you dont need it now
what you dont know you can feel it somehow
what you dont have you dont need it now
dont need it now
was a beautiful day




the sea wants to kiss the golden shore
the sunlight warms your skin
all the beauty thats been lost before
wants to find us again

i cant fight you anymore
its you im fighting for
the sea throws rocks together
but time leaves us polished stones

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

birds fly high in the summer sky
and rest on the breeze
the same wind will take care of you and i
well build our house in the trees

your heart is on my sleeve
did you put it there with a magic marker
for years i would believe
that the world couldnt wash it away

cause we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

are we tough enough
for ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love

we cant fall any further
if we cant feel ordinary love
and we cannot reach any higher
if we cant deal with ordinary love




we probably gonna get killed by tryin to be like somebody else

repeat
yes yes yall yall
and you dont stop stop

once i start up my mind get in lets take a spin
lemme drive you to suicide im gone with the wind
im out my mind and in my mind i travel through space and time
if you find me you see me you cant cause you blind
i decieve like adam and eve you cant believe
that i made the rhythm breathe your eardrums bleed
in time you will find im out my mind
but you dont know cause if you knew me
you would know for sure so let me drive you to suicide

 4x
keep it on keep it on and shockin the place
keep it on keep it on and shockin the place
let me drive you to suicide

once i decide that i dont wanna live no more
well i guess i gotta do what the devil told me to
voodoo its kinda wicked really wonder how im goin under
can you feel the pain when it rain and it start to thunder
i dont really know where i gotta go
heaven or hell either or it dont matter once your brains scattered
once ya cock the hammer come along for the ride
ill see you on the other side and let me drive you to suicide



pop goes the weasel shot gun blasted
hole in my head funeral closed casket
dead body layin on the bathroom floor
so i dont gotta worry bout the pain no more




youve got a face not spoiled by beauty
i have some scars from where ive been
youve got eyes that can see right through me
youre not afraid of anything theyve seen

i was told that i would feel
nothing the first time
i dont know how these cuts heal
but in you i found a right

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
that we shouldnt doubt
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

you let me into a conversation
a conversation only we could make
youre breaking into my imagination
whatevers in there is yours to take

i was told id feel
nothing the first time
you were slow to heal
but this could be the night

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a dark
within and without
and there is a light
dont let it go out

and this is a song
a song for someone
this is a song
a song for someone

and im a long way
from your hill on calvary
and im a long way
from where i was where i need to be

if there is a light
you can always see
and there is a world
we can always be
if there is a kiss
i stole from your mouth
and there is a light
dont let it go out




every breaking wave on the shore
tells the next one therell be one more
and every gambler knows that to lose
is what youre really there for

summer i was fearless
now i speak into an answer phone
like every fallen leaf on the breeze
winter wouldnt leave it alone alone


if you go
if you go your way and i go mine
are we so
are we so helpless against the tide
baby every dog on the street
knows that were in love with defeat
are we ready to be swept off our feet
and stop chasing every breaking wave

every sailor knows that the sea
is a friend made enemy
every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
to live without intimacy

i thought i heard the captains voice
but its hard to listen while you preach
like every broken wave on the shore
this is as far as i could reach



the sea knows where are the rocks
and drowning is no sin
you know where my heart is
the same place that yours has been
we know that we fear to win
and so we end before we begin
before we begin






green light seven eleven 
you stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
you dont smoke dont even want to 
hey now check your change 
dressed up like a car crash 
your wheels are turning but youre upside down 
you say when he hits you you dont mind 
because when he hurts you you feel alive 
hey babe is that what it is 

red lights gray morning 
you stumble out of a hole in the ground 
a vampire or a victim 
it depends on whos around 
you used to stay in to watch the adverts 
you could lip synch to the talk shows 

and if you look you look through me 
and when you talk you talk at me 
and when i touch you you dont feel a thing 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
stayand the day would keep its trust 
stayand the night would be enough 

faraway so close 
up with the static and the radio 
with satelite television 
you can go anywhere 
miami new orleans 
london belfast and berlin 

and if you listen i cant call 
and if you jump you just might fall 
and if you shout ill only hear you 

if i could stay 
then the night would give you up 
staythen the day would keep its trust 
staywith the demons you drowned 
staywith the spirit i found 
stayand the night would be enough 

three oclock in the morning 
its quiet and theres no one around 
just the bang and the clatter 
as an angel runs to ground 

just the bang 
and the clatter 
as an angel 
hits the ground




yeah

all is quiet on new years day
a world in white gets underway
i want to be with you
be with you night and day
nothing changes on new years day
on new years day

i will be with you again
i will be with you again

under a blood red sky
a crowd has gathered in black and white
arms entwined the chosen few
the newspapers says says 
say its true its true
and we can break through
though torn in two 
we can be one

ii will begin again
ii will begin again

oh
maybe the time is right
ohmaybe tonight

i will be with you again
i will be with you again

and so were told this is the golden age
and gold is the reason for the wars we wage
though i want to be with you
be with you night and day
nothing changes 
on new years day
on new years day




my love throws me like a rubber ball
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

but they burn so brightly for her

oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing
oh oh oh the sweetest thing

see the stone set in your eyes
see the thorn twist in your side
i wait for you

sleight of hand and twist of fate
on a bed of nails she makes me wait
and i wait without you

with or without you
with or without you

through the storm we reach the shore
you give it all but i want more
and im waiting for you

with or without you
with or without you
i cant live
with or without you

and you give yourself away
and you give yourself away
and you give
and you give
and you give yourself away

my hands are tied
my body bruised shes got me with
nothing to win and
nothing left to lose

and you give yourself away
and you give yourself away
and you give
and you give
and you give yourself away

with or without you
with or without you
i cant live
with or without you

with or without you
with or without you
i cant live
with or without you
with or without you

uno dos tres catorce
spoken vocal
turn it up loud captain

lights go down it’s dark
the jungle is your head  can’t rule your heart
a feeling is so much stronger than
a thought
your eyes are wide
and though your soul it can’t be bought
your mind can wonder

hello hello hola
im at a place called vertigo dónde estás
it’s everything i wish i didn’t know
except you give me something
i can feel feel

the night is full of holes
as bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
they twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
they know that they can’t dance  at least they know

i can’t stand the beats
i’m asking for the cheque
the girl with crimson nails
has jesus round her neck
swinging to the music  whoooaaa
swinging to the music  whoooaaa

the star
that gives us light
has been gone a while
but it’s not an illusion
the ache
in my heart
is so much a part of who i am
something in your eyes
took a thousand years to get here
something in your eyes
took a thousand years a thousand years

hold me close hold me close and don’t let me go
hold me close like i’m someone that you might know
hold me close the darkness just lets us see
who we are
i’ve got your life inside of me

iris… iris…

once we are born we begin to forget
the very reason we came
but you
i’m sure i’ve met
long before the night the stars went out
we’re meeting up again

hold me close hold me close and don’t let me go
hold me close like i’m someone that you might know
hold me close the darkness just lets us see
who we are
i’ve got your life inside of me

iris… iris…

the stars are bright but do they know
the uni is beautiful but cold

you took me by the hand
i thought that i was leading you
but it was you made me your man
machine
i dream
where you are
iris standing in the hall
she tells me i can do it all
iris wakes to my nightmares
don’t fear the world it isn’t there

iris playing on the strand
she buries the boy beneath the sand
iris says that i will be the death of her
it was not me

iris… iris…

free yourself to be yourself if only you could see yourself
free yourself to be yourself if only you could see…




somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

you think it’s easier
to put your finger on the trouble
when the trouble is you
and you think it’s easier
to know your own tricks
well it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do

i have a will for survival
so you can hurt me and hurt me some more
i can live with denial
but you’re not my troubles anymore

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till somebody else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

you think it’s easier
to give up on the trouble
if the trouble is destroying you
you think it’s easier
but before you threw me a rope
it was the one thing i could hold on to

i have a will for survival
so you can hurt me then hurt me some more
i can live with denial
but you’re not my troubles anymore

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

god knows it’s not easy
taking on the shape of someone else’s pain
god now you can see me
i’m naked and i’m not afraid
my body’s sacred and i’m not ashamed

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

somebody stepped inside your soul
somebody stepped inside your soul
little by little they robbed and stole
till someone else was in control

i was looking at myself

a boy tries hard to be a man
his mother takes him by his hand
if he stops to think he starts to cry

is there a time for keeping a distance 
a time to turn your eyes away 
is there a time for keeping your head down 
for getting on with your day 

is there a time for kohl and lipstick 
a time for cutting hair 
is there a time for high street shopping 
to find the right dress to wear 

here she comes 
heads turn around 
here she comes 
to take her crown 

is there a time to walk for cover 
a time for kiss and tell 
is there a time for different colors 
different names you find it hard to spell 

is there a time for first communion 
a time for east 17 
is there a time to turn the mecca 
is there a time to be a beauty queen 

here she comes 
beauty plays the crown 
here she comes 
surreal in her crown

dici che il fiume 
trova la via al mare 
e come il fiume 
giungerai a me 
oltre i confini 
e le terre assetate 
dici che come fiume

lamore 
e non so pi pregare 
e nellamore non so pi sperare 
e quellamore non so pi aspettare

you say that the river 
finds the way to the sea 
and as the river 
youll come to me 
beyond the borders 
and the thirsty lands 
you say that as river

love 
and i cannot pray anymore 
and i cannot hope in love anymore 
and i cannot wait for love anymore

is there a time for tying ribbons 
a time for christmas trees 
is there a time for laying tables 
when the night is set to freeze




morning your toast your tea and sugar
read about the politician’s lover
go through the day like knife through butter
why don’t you
you dress in the colours of forgiveness
your eyes as red as christmas
purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair

you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
in your dreams everything is alright
tomorrow dawns like someone else’s suicide
you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight

dreams
it’s a dirty business dreaming
where there is silence and not screaming
where there’s no daylight there’s no healing
no no

you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
in your dreams everything is alright
tomorrow dawns like a suicide
but you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight

hope is where the door is
when the church is where the war is
where no one can feel no one else’s pain

you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
in your dreams everything is alright
tomorrow dawns like a suicide
but you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight

sleep like a baby tonight
like a bird your dreams will take flight
like st francis covered in light
you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight




the sea it swells like a sore head and the night it is aching
two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed
and the day it is breaking

on rainy days wed go swimming out
on rainy days swimming in the sound
on rainy days wed go swimming out

youre in my mind all of the time
i know thats not enough
if the sky can crack there must be someway back 
for love and only love

electrical storm

coffee is cold but itll get you through
compromise thats nothing new to you
lets see colours that have never been seen
lets go places no one else has been

youre in my mind all of the time
i know thats not enough
well if the sky can crack there must be someway back
to love and only love

electrical storm x3
baby dont cry

its hot as hell honey in this room
sure hope the weather will break soon
the air is heavy heavy as a truck
we need the rain to wash away our bad luck

well if the sky can crack there must be some way back
to love and only love

electrical storm x3

baby dont cry x3
